                <h2>Custom Servo Press Machine Integration</h2>
                <p>I'll be blunt: if you're still running pneumatic presses on a quality-critical assembly operation, you're flying blind. A pneumatic cylinder hits a force target — maybe — and tells you nothing about what happened between start and finish. You've got no curve data, no position feedback, and no way to distinguish a good press from one that's 0.3 mm short of full seat. That's not acceptable when your customer's running IATF 16949 and expects zero PPM defects.</p>

                <p>Servo presses change the equation completely. Instead of slamming an air cylinder and hoping for the best, you've got a brushless servo motor driving a ball screw or roller screw with closed-loop force and position control throughout the entire stroke. You control the approach velocity (typically 50–200 mm/s), the insertion speed (as low as 0.5 mm/s for delicate press-fits), the force profile, and the final position — all while recording the complete force-displacement signature at sampling rates of 1,000 Hz or higher. That curve is your proof of quality, and it's what separates a modern assembly operation from a liability.</p>

                <p>AMD Machines has been a <strong>servo press integrator</strong> for over two decades. We've delivered hundreds of turnkey systems — standalone press stations, multi-station <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/solutions/assembly/">assembly lines</a>, and <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/solutions/robotic-cells/">robotic cells</a> — across automotive, medical device, electronics, and heavy equipment manufacturing. We don't just bolt a press to a bench. We engineer the complete system: fixturing, part handling, controls architecture, force monitoring, data collection, and integration with your MES. Every system ships fully debugged and run-off using your production parts.</p>

        <div class="overview-grid">
            <div class="overview-content">
                <h3>The Drive Mechanism</h3>
                <p>A servo press replaces the pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder with a permanent-magnet synchronous servo motor coupled to a precision mechanical actuator — usually a ball screw for forces under 100 kN or a planetary roller screw for heavier loads. The roller screw's multiple contact points distribute the load across dozens of threads simultaneously, giving you 10x the service life of a comparable ball screw at high forces. This is why Kistler's NCFN series and Promess EMAP units use roller screws for their higher-capacity models.</p>

                <p>The motor is controlled by a servo drive (typically from Bosch Rexroth, Siemens, or Beckhoff) running a cascaded position-velocity-current control loop at update rates of 4 kHz or faster. The inner current loop controls torque (and therefore force), the velocity loop manages approach and pressing speeds, and the outer position loop tracks the ram location to ±0.01 mm or better. This architecture gives you independent control over force, speed, and position at every point in the stroke — something no pneumatic or hydraulic system can match.</p>

                <h3>The Force-Position Feedback Loop</h3>
                <p>Every servo press we integrate includes both a high-resolution motor encoder (for position) and an external load cell mounted between the press ram and the tooling (for force). Some engineers try to derive force from motor current alone — don't do it. Motor current reflects the sum of pressing force, friction, and inertia. On a 50 kN press, the difference between current-derived force and actual load cell force can be 500 N or more, especially during acceleration phases. That error is unacceptable for press-fit verification on precision components. We always specify a dedicated strain-gauge or piezoelectric load cell for direct force measurement.</p>

                <h3>Key Components in a Servo Press Station</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Servo actuator</strong> — the motor, gearbox (if used), and screw assembly. Rated by maximum force, stroke length, and duty cycle</li>
                    <li><strong>Press frame</strong> — C-frame for accessibility or 4-post frame for off-center load capability. We design custom frames when standard options don't fit your process</li>
                    <li><strong>Load cell</strong> — strain gauge (Kistler, HBM, Futek) for static and quasi-static loads or piezoelectric for ultra-fast dynamic measurements</li>
                    <li><strong>Press controller</strong> — dedicated hardware (Kistler maXYmos, Promess UltraPRO) or PLC-based (Allen-Bradley ControlLogix with servo axis module)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tooling</strong> — upper and lower press tooling, quick-change coupling, alignment features, and <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/solutions/machine-vision/">vision-guided</a> part presence verification</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety system</strong> — two-hand controls, light curtains (Keyence SL-V, Omron F3SG), or full guarding per ANSI/NFPA 79 and ISO 13849 PLd/PLe</li>

                    <h3>Servo Press for Press-Fit Assembly</h3>
                    <p>This is the bread and butter — and the application where servo presses deliver the most value over pneumatics. When you're pressing bearings, bushings, seals, or pins into housings, the force-displacement curve is your quality certificate. It tells you whether the interference fit was correct, whether the bore was in spec, and whether the component seated to the right depth. A pneumatic press gives you none of that.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="app-grid">

                    <h4>Bearing Press-Fit</h4>
                    <p>Bearing installation is unforgiving. Press too hard and you'll brinell the races — the bearing will pass initial inspection but fail early in the field. Press too little and you've got a loose fit that walks out under vibration. We set envelope windows on the force-displacement curve that catch undersized bores (insertion force too low), oversized bores (zero interference detected), contamination (erratic curve shape), and incomplete seating (final position out of tolerance). Typical bearing press forces range from 5–80 kN depending on bearing size and housing material.</p>

                <div class="app-item">
                    <h4>Bushing & Seal Insertion</h4>
                    <p>Bushing press-fits typically need multi-phase force profiles: a gentle approach at 1–2 mm/s to find the chamfer, controlled insertion at constant velocity, then a position-based stop with final force verification. We've pressed everything from tiny 6 mm PTFE bushings in medical valves (at 200 N) to 80 mm bronze bushings in heavy equipment linkages (at 60 kN). Each application gets a tuned force profile, not a one-size-fits-all program.</p>

                <div class="app-item">
                    <h4>Shaft & Rotor Insertion</h4>
                    <p>Motor assembly is a growing application — especially with the EV transition driving massive demand for electric motor production. Pressing a rotor shaft through a lamination stack requires controlling axial force to avoid deforming laminations while maintaining alignment to ±0.02 mm. We've built servo press stations for rotor assembly running at 12-second cycle times on FANUC robot-tended lines, producing 450+ motors per shift.</p>

                    <h4>Pin & Insert Pressing</h4>
                    <p>Dowel pins, roll pins, threaded inserts, heat-set inserts — each has different force characteristics and failure modes. Dowel pins generate a predictable flat-topped curve; roll pins show a characteristic double peak as the pin compresses and then springs into position. Our systems learn these signatures and reject anything that doesn't match. We press 2–16 pins per cycle on multi-station <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/solutions/assembly/">rotary dial machines</a>, running at sub-4-second cycle times.</p>

                <strong>War Story — The Invisible Defect:</strong> A Tier 1 automotive customer came to us after receiving a 150,000-unit sort request from their OEM. Bearings were walking out of housings in the field. Their pneumatic press showed "good" on every unit. When we instrumented the operation with a Kistler NCFN servo press and maXYmos monitoring, we found that 3.2% of housings had bores 8 microns below the low limit — enough to reduce interference fit below spec, but invisible to a go/no-go gauge. The force-displacement curve caught every single one. Zero field returns since installation.

                    <h3>Servo Press for Crimping, Staking & Riveting</h3>
                    <p>Controlled deformation is where servo presses really flex their muscles. Unlike press-fits where you're pushing a round peg into a round hole, crimping and staking involve permanently deforming material. Too little deformation and the joint's weak. Too much and you've cracked the housing or damaged the component. The servo press lets you dial in exactly the right force-position endpoint.</p>

                    <h4>Terminal Crimping</h4>
                    <p>For wire harness and electrical connector manufacturing, crimp height and crimp force are the two critical parameters. Our servo press crimping stations monitor both — force to detect missing strands or wrong wire gauge, and final crimp height (via the position encoder) to ±0.02 mm. Typical cycle times: 1.5–3 seconds per crimp including load/unload.</p>

                    <h4>Orbital & Radial Staking</h4>
                    <p>Staking operations permanently deform a boss or flange to lock components in place. Orbital staking produces a clean, consistent mushroom with lower axial force than flat staking — typically 30–50% less. We integrate servo-driven orbital staking heads from Orbitform and BalTec, and we verify every joint with force-angle monitoring to confirm complete material flow.</p>

                    <h4>Self-Piercing Rivets (SPR)</h4>
                    <p>SPR is increasingly common in automotive body-in-white and structural assemblies where spot welding mixed materials isn't feasible. We integrate servo press SPR systems running at forces of 40–80 kN, with real-time monitoring of rivet insertion force, punch displacement, and die-side interlock formation. Each joint gets a unique curve signature stored against the vehicle VIN.</p>

                    <h4>Precision Metal Forming</h4>
                    <p>Servo presses let you program a slow approach velocity through the forming zone (5–20 mm/s), then rapid return. This controlled deceleration reduces shock loading on dies by 40–60% compared to mechanical presses, extending tool life from 50,000 hits to 200,000+ hits in some applications. The force-position data also catches die wear before it produces scrap — we've seen slope changes in the forming curve predict tool failure 2,000–5,000 cycles before visual inspection would catch it.</p>

                    <h4>Embossing & Coining</h4>
                    <p>Embossing requires precise depth control and uniform force distribution across the part surface. Our servo press embossing stations hold depth tolerance to ±0.005 mm using closed-loop position control. Common applications: serial number embossing on <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/solutions/marking-traceability/">traceable components</a>, decorative embossing on consumer products, and Braille marking on medical packaging.</p>

                    <h4>Punching & Piercing</h4>
                    <p>The controlled breakthrough capability is the key advantage for punching. A mechanical press hits the material at full speed; a servo press decelerates before breakthrough, reducing the snap-through shock that wears punches and cracks dies. We've seen 3x improvement in punch life on stainless steel applications by programming a 70% velocity reduction in the final 2 mm of travel.</p>

            <h2>Force-Displacement Monitoring — The Real Reason You Buy a Servo Press</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">The press itself is just the actuator. The force-displacement monitoring system is where you get the quality data that justifies the investment and satisfies your customer's traceability requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="monitoring-grid">
            <div class="monitoring-main">
                <div class="monitoring-feature">
                    <h3>How Force-Displacement Monitoring Works</h3>
                    <p>During every press cycle, the controller samples force (from the load cell) and position (from the motor encoder or external linear encoder) at rates of 500–4,000 Hz. That's 1,000–8,000 data points on a typical 2-second press stroke. The result is a force-displacement curve — a fingerprint of the press operation that reveals exactly what happened between the parts.</p>

                    <p>The controller compares each curve in real-time against user-defined acceptance windows: upper and lower force limits at key positions, slope thresholds, area-under-curve calculations, and final position tolerances. A good part falls inside every window. A bad part trips one or more limits and gets immediately flagged for rejection. On our systems, the pass/fail decision takes less than 10 milliseconds after the press stroke completes — fast enough that the reject diverter fires before the next station index.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="monitoring-feature">
                    <h3>What the Curve Tells You</h3>
                    <p>Twenty years of reading press curves has taught us that the curve doesn't just tell you pass or fail — it tells you <em>why</em> a part failed, and often predicts failures before they happen:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Initial contact point shifted</strong> — part is sitting wrong in the fixture, or wrong part loaded entirely</li>
                        <li><strong>Insertion slope too low</strong> — bore is oversized, insufficient interference fit. Material batch change?</li>
                        <li><strong>Insertion slope too high</strong> — bore is undersized or contaminated. Check incoming inspection</li>
                        <li><strong>Erratic mid-stroke signature</strong> — surface scoring, misalignment, or chip trapped in the bore</li>
                        <li><strong>Peak force creeping upward over time</strong> — tooling wearing, bore geometry drifting. Schedule maintenance before scrap</li>
                        <li><strong>Final position out of window</strong> — component didn't seat fully, or wrong stack-up height</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We configure Kistler maXYmos and Promess UltraPRO controllers to display the live curve on the HMI with color-coded pass/fail zones. Operators see green for good and red for reject — no interpretation required.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="monitoring-feature">
                    <h3>In-Process Quality Monitoring and Poka-Yoke</h3>
                    <p>The monitoring system doesn't just record data — it acts on it. Every station we build includes physical reject segregation: a bad part gets diverted to a locked reject bin, and the system won't cycle again until the operator acknowledges the fault. That's true poka-yoke — it's physically impossible for a bad press-fit to reach the next operation. For <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/industries/automotive/">automotive</a> and <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/industries/medical/">medical device</a> customers, this level of in-process quality control is non-negotiable.</p>

                <h3>Automotive EV Motor Assembly — Rotor Shaft Press-Fit</h3>
                <p>An automotive Tier 1 supplier needed to press rotor shafts into lamination stacks for a new EV traction motor program. Requirements: 35 kN maximum press force, ±0.015 mm position accuracy, 100% force-displacement curve traceability linked to each motor serial number, and a 14-second cycle time including FANUC robot load/unload.</p>
                <p>We built a dual-station servo press cell with Promess EMAP 50 kN actuators, each running independent press programs. A FANUC M-20iD/25 robot loads raw stacks and unloads pressed assemblies. Keyence IV2 vision confirms part orientation before pressing. Every curve is stored against the motor's 2D Data Matrix code and exported to the plant's Ignition SCADA system.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> 14.2-second average cycle time (beating target), 99.7% first-pass yield (up from 96.8% on the previous pneumatic line), zero customer complaints in 14 months of production. The curve data caught a supplier's lamination stamping die wear issue three weeks before it would have produced out-of-spec stacks — saving an estimated $280,000 in scrap and sorting costs.</p>

                <h3>Medical Device — Catheter Hub Crimping Station</h3>
                <p>A Class III medical device manufacturer required a validated servo press station for crimping stainless steel hubs onto PTFE catheter tubing. The press needed to crimp at exactly 850 ±25 N with a final crimp diameter tolerance of ±0.03 mm. Full 21 CFR Part 11 compliance, electronic batch records, and IQ/OQ/PQ validation documentation were required.</p>
                <p>We specified a Kistler NCFE 5 kN joining module with maXYmos TL process monitoring. The system uses a piezoelectric force sensor for its millinewton-level resolution — critical when your process window is only 50 N wide. A Cognex In-Sight 2800 camera verifies tube position before crimping, and a Keyence LS-9000 series laser micrometer measures post-crimp diameter on 100% of parts. All data logs to an SQL database with 21 CFR Part 11-compliant audit trails.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> Cpk of 2.1 on crimp force (target was 1.67), zero crimp failures in 18 months of production, IQ/OQ/PQ completed in 10 weeks. The system replaced a manual crimping operation that required 100% pull-test destructive testing on samples — now pull testing is done only for periodic validation, saving 15% of production output that was previously destroyed for QC.</p>

                <h3>Electronics — Connector Pin Insertion for Automotive ECU</h3>
                <p>An <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/industries/electronics/">electronics</a> manufacturer needed to press 48 connector pins into a PCB housing at a rate of 600 units per hour. Pins were arranged in a 6x8 grid with 2.54 mm pitch. Individual pin insertion force: 15–40 N. Any pin outside the force window meant a rejected unit — and at $35 per housing, scrap costs were significant.</p>
                <p>We built a servo press station with a Schmidt ServoPress 420 (5 kN capacity) and a custom 48-pin press tool with individual compliance springs. The press executes a single stroke that inserts all 48 pins simultaneously while the monitoring system evaluates the aggregate force curve. A Kistler maXYmos BL controller with 4 monitoring channels evaluates sub-windows for each quadrant of the pin field, catching localized issues like a missing pin or a plugged housing hole.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> 5.8-second cycle time (beating the 6-second target), first-pass yield improvement from 94.2% to 99.4%, annual scrap savings of $185,000. The system also identified an incoming supplier quality issue — a batch of housings with slightly undersized pin holes — within the first 50 units of the bad lot, before it contaminated the production line.</p>

                <h2>Servo Press Retrofit & Upgrades</h2>
                <p class="lead">Already have press stations running pneumatic cylinders? We can retrofit them to servo with full force monitoring — often at 40–60% of the cost of a new system. It's one of the highest-ROI <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/services/upgrades-retrofits/">upgrade projects</a> we do.</p>

                <h3>Replace Pneumatic Press with Servo Press</h3>
                <p>Here's a scenario we see constantly: your customer just updated their control plan and now requires force-displacement monitoring on a press operation that's been running pneumatic for 10 years. You don't need a new machine — you need a servo press retrofit. Our typical pneumatic-to-servo conversion includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Removal of existing cylinder, valving, and FRL (filter-regulator-lubricator)</li>
                    <li>Installation of a servo actuator into the existing press frame (we design adapter plates to fit your bolt pattern)</li>
                    <li>New servo controller with force-displacement monitoring and data logging</li>
                    <li>Updated safety system to current ANSI/NFPA 79 and ISO 13849 standards</li>
                    <li>Operator training, documentation, and <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/services/spare-parts/">spare parts kit</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most retrofit projects go from purchase order to production in 8–12 weeks. We build and test the retrofit kit at our facility, then install on-site during a planned shutdown — typically a weekend.</p>

                <h3>Add Force Monitoring to Existing Servo Press</h3>
                <p>Sometimes you've already got a servo press but no monitoring system — or the old monitoring hardware is obsolete and unsupported. We retrofit modern Kistler maXYmos or standalone monitoring systems onto existing servo and hydraulic presses, adding load cells, encoders, and data connections without touching the press mechanics.</p>

            <h2>The ROI of Servo Press Integration</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Servo presses cost more upfront than pneumatic. Here's why they pay for themselves — usually faster than you'd expect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="overview-grid">
            <div class="overview-content">
                <h3>Direct Cost Savings</h3>
                <p>The biggest financial driver is usually <strong>scrap reduction</strong>. If your pneumatic press line runs a 2–4% defect rate on a component worth $5–$50 in material, and you're producing 200,000+ units per year, the math is straightforward. A servo press with force-displacement monitoring typically brings defect rates below 0.3%. On a $15 part at 300,000 units/year, dropping from 3% to 0.3% scrap saves <strong>$121,500/year</strong> in material alone — not counting labor for rework, sorting, and customer charge-backs.</p>

                <p><strong>Labor reduction</strong> is the second driver. A servo press station with automated part handling (robot or pick-and-place) replaces 1–3 manual press operators per shift. At a fully burdened cost of $55,000–$65,000/operator/year, that's $110,000–$390,000/year in labor savings on a two-shift operation.</p>

                <p><strong>Energy savings</strong> are real but usually not the primary justification. A servo press draws power only during the press stroke (typically 1–3 seconds out of a 6–15 second cycle). A pneumatic press requires continuous compressed air — and compressed air is the most expensive utility in most factories at $0.25–$0.30 per 1,000 cubic feet. We've measured 60–75% energy reduction on pneumatic-to-servo conversions.</p>

                <h3>Typical Payback Periods</h3>
                <p>For a standalone servo press station ($80,000–$180,000 installed), payback typically runs <strong>8–18 months</strong>. For a multi-press integrated cell ($250,000–$500,000), payback runs <strong>12–24 months</strong>. These numbers assume two-shift operation — add a third shift and payback accelerates by 30–40%.</p>

                <p>The number that's harder to quantify but often the real motivation: <strong>avoided cost of quality failures</strong>. A single customer line-stop caused by a defective press-fit can cost $10,000–$50,000 per hour in warranty charges, expedited shipping, and containment activity. One prevented line-stop can pay for the monitoring system by itself.</p>

            <h2>Common Servo Press Challenges and How to Solve Them</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">After hundreds of servo press projects, here are the issues we see most often — and how we address them before they become production problems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="overview-content" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
            <h3>"Our force curves pass, but parts still fail in the field."</h3>
            <p>This usually means your monitoring windows are too wide. We see this when engineers set initial limits using min/max from a small sample set. The fix: run 300+ known-good parts, statistically calculate 3-sigma or 6-sigma envelopes, and add zone-specific windows at critical curve inflection points. A single upper/lower force limit isn't enough — you need position-dependent windows that follow the shape of the curve.</p>

            <h3>"We can't justify the cost of a servo press for a low-volume application."</h3>
            <p>Consider the cost of a single field failure. If your product goes into a <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/industries/medical/">medical device</a> or <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/industries/aerospace/">aerospace assembly</a>, one warranty claim can exceed the cost of the press system. For true low-volume applications (under 10,000/year), a manual load / servo press / manual unload station is often the right answer — you get the process data and quality assurance without the cost of full automation.</p>

            <h3>"Our press runs fine during qualification but drifts in production."</h3>
            <p>Nine times out of ten, this is a tooling or fixture issue, not a press issue. Tooling wears, nests get contaminated with chips, and fixtures drift out of alignment. We design our press stations with tool wear detection built into the monitoring — if the curve slope changes by more than a user-defined percentage, the system flags the trend and alerts maintenance before it produces rejects. Proper fixture design with alignment pins, hardened wear surfaces, and easy cleaning access prevents most drift issues.</p>

            <h3>"We need to run multiple part numbers on the same press."</h3>
            <p>Recipe management handles this. We store separate press programs (force profiles, speed settings, monitoring windows) for each part number and switch automatically via barcode scan. For parts requiring different tooling, we design quick-change fixtures with RFID verification — the system confirms the correct tooling is installed before allowing a cycle. Changeover time: typically under 2 minutes for tooling, zero time for recipe-only changes.</p>

            <h3>"Our IT department won't allow the press controller on the plant network."</h3>
            <p>We get it — cybersecurity is a real concern, especially in <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/industries/defense/">defense</a> and regulated manufacturing. We design isolated network architectures with the press controller on a dedicated machine subnet, communicating to the MES through a managed switch or data diode. OPC UA with certificate-based authentication is our preferred protocol for secure data exchange. We'll work with your IT security team to meet their requirements.</p>

            <h2>Servo Press FAQ</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="overview-content" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
            <h3>What's the difference between a servo press and an electric press?</h3>
            <p>Technically, a servo press <em>is</em> an electric press — it uses an electric servo motor instead of pneumatics or hydraulics. The term "electric press" sometimes refers to simpler electric actuators without closed-loop force control or curve monitoring. When we say "servo press," we mean a system with full servo control of force, position, and velocity, plus real-time force-displacement monitoring. That monitoring capability is what separates a servo press from a basic electric cylinder.</p>

            <h3>Can a servo press replace my hydraulic press?</h3>
            <p>In most cases, yes — and you'll get better controllability, cleaner operation (no oil leaks), lower energy costs, and complete process data. The main limitation is force capacity: most servo presses top out around 400–600 kN, while hydraulic presses can generate thousands of kN. For applications above 500 kN, we sometimes use TOX pneumohydraulic units that combine the force capacity of hydraulics with servo-like position control. For deep-draw forming or very high tonnage operations, hydraulic may still be the right answer.</p>

            <h3>How often does a servo press need calibration?</h3>
            <p>The press actuator itself doesn't require calibration — the servo motor encoder is absolute and doesn't drift. The load cell should be calibrated annually (or per your quality system requirements) using a traceable reference standard. We provide calibration procedures and can perform on-site calibration as part of a <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/services/maintenance-support/">maintenance contract</a>. Some customers in regulated industries calibrate every 6 months; most industrial customers calibrate annually.</p>

            <h3>What cycle times can a servo press achieve?</h3>
            <p>The press stroke itself typically takes 1–4 seconds depending on stroke length and pressing speed. Total station cycle time — including part load, pressing, monitoring evaluation, and unload — ranges from 4–20 seconds for most applications. We've built high-speed stations with 2.5-second total cycle times on short-stroke, light-force applications (connector pin insertion). The press speed is rarely the bottleneck; part handling and monitoring evaluation time usually determine the cycle.</p>

            <h3>Do you provide turnkey installation and startup support?</h3>
            <p>Every system ships fully built, wired, programmed, and run-off at our facility using your production parts. On-site installation typically takes 3–5 days for a standalone station, 1–3 weeks for a multi-station cell. We provide operator and maintenance <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/services/training/">training</a>, spare parts recommendations, and ongoing technical support. Our <a href="{{ config.site.base_path }}/services/consulting/">automation consulting</a> team can also help you develop the application requirements and business case before the project starts.</p>

            <h3>What data format does the force-displacement curve use?</h3>
            <p>Most press controllers store curves as CSV or proprietary binary files. We configure data export in whatever format your quality system needs: CSV for simple database import, JSON for web-based MES platforms, or direct SQL INSERT for real-time database logging. Kistler maXYmos supports OPC UA data publishing; Promess UltraPRO supports Ethernet/IP explicit messaging. We've also built custom middleware to translate curve data into XML for legacy MES systems.</p>

            <h3>How do you size the right servo press for my application?</h3>
            <p>We need three things to start: your maximum required press force (with safety margin — we typically spec 130–150% of the calculated max force), the stroke length, and the duty cycle (presses per minute, shifts per day). Beyond those basics, we consider the force profile shape (constant force, ramp, or multi-step), the required speed range, the position accuracy needed, and whether you need a ball screw (lower cost, lower force) or roller screw (higher cost, higher force, longer life).
