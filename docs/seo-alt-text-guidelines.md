## General Best Practices

### DO:
1. **Be specific** - "FANUC M-20iD robot welding exhaust manifold" not "robot welding"
2. **Include industry context** - "for Tier 1 automotive supplier" or "in ISO Class 7 cleanroom"
3. **Mention capabilities** - "with real-time weld monitoring" or "achieving 99.9% uptime"
4. **Use natural language** - Write as if describing to a colleague
5. **Include brand names** when relevant (FANUC, ABB, KUKA, Cognex, Keyence)

### DON'T:
1. Start with "Image of..." or "Photo of..."
2. Stuff keywords unnaturally
3. Use vague descriptions like "automation equipment"
4. Exceed 125 characters (optimal for screen readers)
5. Duplicate alt text across multiple images

## Alt Text by Page Type

### Case Study Pages
Focus on the specific solution delivered:
- "Custom robotic welding cell built for [Client Industry] achieving [Key Metric]"

### Solution Pages
Focus on capability demonstration:
- "[Solution Type] system demonstrating [Key Feature] for [Application]"

### Blog/Resource Pages
Focus on educational context:
- "Diagram showing [Concept] in [Application Context]"
- "Comparison of [Technology A] vs [Technology B] for [Use Case]"
