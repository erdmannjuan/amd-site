AMD Automation leverages digital twin technology and advanced simulation software to design, validate, and optimize your automation systems before physical construction begins. This Industry 4.0 approach reduces project risk, accelerates deployment, and enables continuous improvement throughout the system lifecycle.

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual replica of your physical automation system that mirrors real-world behavior in a simulated environment. Our digital twins include:

- **3D mechanical models** of robots, fixtures, and equipment
- **Motion simulation** with accurate cycle times and trajectories
- **PLC logic simulation** to validate control sequences
- **Sensor and I/O mapping** for complete system behavior
- **Real-time data synchronization** for operational optimization

## Benefits of Virtual Commissioning

### Reduce Project Risk
Test and validate your automation concept before cutting metal. Virtual commissioning identifies:
- Robot reach and interference issues
- Cycle time optimization opportunities
- Safety system coverage gaps
- Control logic errors

### Accelerate Time-to-Production
- Develop robot programs offline while equipment is being built
- Validate PLC code before on-site installation
- Train operators before the system arrives
- Reduce on-site commissioning time by 30-50%

### Lower Total Cost
- Catch design errors early when changes are inexpensive
- Reduce physical prototyping requirements
- Minimize costly on-site modifications
- Optimize cycle times for maximum throughput

## Simulation Software Platforms

## Digital Twin Applications

### New System Design & Validation
Before building your [robotic cell](/solutions/robotic-cells/) or [welding system](/solutions/welding/), we create a complete digital twin to:

- Validate robot selection and placement
- Optimize cell layout and floor space
- Verify reach, payload, and cycle time
- Test safety system coverage
- Develop and debug robot programs

### Offline Robot Programming (OLP)
Generate production-ready robot programs without stopping production:

- Create new programs for product variants
- Optimize existing paths for cycle time reduction
- Test program changes in simulation
- Download validated programs to production robots

### Process Optimization
Use digital twin data to continuously improve:

- Identify bottlenecks and balance cycle times
- Simulate "what-if" scenarios for throughput improvement
- Plan maintenance windows with production impact analysis
- Validate changeover procedures

### Operator Training
Train operators in a risk-free virtual environment:

- Practice normal operations and procedures
- Simulate fault conditions and recovery
- Learn troubleshooting without production impact
- Validate competency before live operation

## Virtual Commissioning Process

### Phase 1: Model Development
We build accurate 3D models of all system components:
- Import CAD data from your design team
- Create kinematic models of robots and motion axes
- Define gripper and tooling geometry
- Model sensors, conveyors, and safety devices

### Phase 2: Program Development
Develop and validate all automation programs:
- Robot motion programs and paths
- PLC ladder logic and function blocks
- HMI screens and operator interfaces
- Safety PLC programming

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
Test complete system behavior in simulation:
- Run full production cycles
- Test all operating modes (auto, manual, maintenance)
- Validate safety system response
- Verify error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Validation & Handoff
Document and transfer validated programs:
- Create program backup and documentation
- Generate cycle time reports
- Provide simulation models for future use
- Support physical commissioning

## Industries Leveraging Digital Twins

Digital twin technology delivers value across industries including [automotive](/industries/automotive/) production validation, [medical device](/industries/medical/) process documentation, [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/) program development, and [electronics](/industries/electronics/) assembly optimization.

## Integration with Physical Systems

Our digital twins don't stop at commissioning. Connect your digital twin to production systems for:

- **Real-time monitoring** - Mirror production data in the digital environment
- **Predictive maintenance** - Simulate wear and predict failures
- **Continuous improvement** - Test changes virtually before implementation
- **Remote support** - Troubleshoot issues using the digital model
