Here's a truth most people in this industry won't tell you: roughly 40% of automation projects that fail do so before a single piece of metal gets cut. They fail in the planning phase — wrong technology selected, unrealistic cycle time assumptions, overlooked integration challenges, or simply trying to automate a process that wasn't ready for it. After 30 years and more than 2,500 machines delivered, we've seen every flavor of automation success and failure. Our consulting practice exists to make sure your project lands in the success column.

We're not management consultants who hand you a binder full of buzzwords. We're engineers who've actually built the systems, debugged them at 2 AM, and optimized them until they hit rate. That hands-on experience is what makes our consulting different — and what makes it actionable.

## Why Automation Consulting Matters More Than Ever

The automation landscape has gotten exponentially more complex in the last decade. When I started in this business, your choices were essentially a FANUC robot or a dedicated hard-automation machine. Today, you're picking between collaborative robots from Universal Robots, high-speed SCARA arms from Epson, traditional six-axis cells from FANUC or ABB, mobile platforms from OTTO Motors, and AI-powered vision systems from Cognex or Keyence. Each one has sweet spots and blind spots.

Making the wrong technology choice doesn't just waste capital — it wastes time. A facility manager who installs a cobot cell expecting 12-second cycle times, only to find it can't get below 18 seconds due to payload limitations, is now six months behind schedule and $150,000 in the hole. That's exactly the kind of mistake our consulting engagement prevents.

The companies that consistently get the best returns on automation are the ones that invest in proper front-end planning. We've tracked our clients' projects over the years, and those who go through a structured consulting and assessment process achieve **15-25% higher OEE** in the first year compared to those who jump straight into equipment procurement.

## Our Consulting Services

### Feasibility Studies

This is where every good automation project starts. A feasibility study answers the most fundamental question: *should* you automate this process, and if so, *how*?

**What We Actually Do:**

We don't just tour your plant and hand you a PowerPoint. Our engineers spend time on your production floor — sometimes multiple days — observing operators, measuring cycle times with stopwatches (yes, we still do that), and understanding the subtle process variations that don't show up in your MES data.

We evaluate:

- **Process suitability** — Some processes automate beautifully. Others fight you every step of the way. We'll tell you which category yours falls into and why.
- **Technical constraints** — Part presentation, tolerance stack-ups, material handling challenges, environmental conditions. The stuff that kills projects when you discover it during commissioning instead of during planning.
- **Production volume and mix** — A dedicated [assembly system](/solutions/assembly/) makes sense at 500,000 parts per year. At 50,000, you might need a flexible [robotic cell](/solutions/robotic-cells/) instead. We help you pick the right architecture for your actual volumes.
- **Integration complexity** — How does this system connect to your existing lines, your MES, your quality systems? We map every interface point.
- **Workforce transition** — Automation changes jobs, and that transition needs planning. We help you develop realistic retraining and redeployment strategies.

**Deliverables you'll actually use:**

Every feasibility study produces a technical feasibility report with preliminary concepts, a risk register with mitigation strategies, and a clear go/no-go recommendation. No wishy-washy "it depends" — we give you a straight answer backed by data.

### ROI Analysis

Let's talk money. Every automation project needs to make financial sense, and we've built ROI models for everything from $50,000 cobot cells to $15 million assembly lines. We know where the real savings hide — and where the hidden costs lurk.

**Investment Side — What It Really Costs:**

Most equipment quotes cover about 70% of the true project cost. We capture the other 30% that surprises people:

- Capital equipment (robots, tooling, controls, safety systems)
- Installation, rigging, and facility modifications
- Controls integration and programming (often 15-20% of total)
- Training — not just operators, but maintenance techs and engineers
- Production ramp-up period (typically 2-6 weeks of reduced output)
- Spare parts inventory to support uptime targets
- Ongoing [maintenance and support](/services/maintenance-support/) costs

**Return Side — Where the Money Comes From:**

Direct labor savings are usually the easy calculation. The bigger wins often come from:

- **Throughput gains** — A well-designed automated line typically runs 85-92% OEE versus 65-75% for manual operations
- **Quality improvements** — Automated [test systems](/solutions/test-systems/) and [vision inspection](/solutions/machine-vision/) catch defects that manual inspection misses, reducing warranty claims by 30-60%
- **Scrap reduction** — Consistent process control cuts scrap rates. We've seen clients go from 4% scrap to under 0.5%
- **Safety improvements** — Fewer ergonomic injuries means lower workers' comp costs and reduced absenteeism
- **Capacity unlocked** — Running lights-out or adding a third shift without hiring

**Financial Metrics We Calculate:**

- Simple payback period (most projects target 18-24 months)
- Net present value (NPV) over 7-10 year equipment life
- Internal rate of return (IRR) — we typically see 25-45% for well-planned projects
- Total cost of ownership (TCO) including maintenance, energy, and consumables

### Technology Assessment and Selection

This is where our 30 years of building systems pays off. We've integrated robots from FANUC, ABB, Yaskawa Motoman, KUKA, Universal Robots, and Epson. We've deployed vision systems from Cognex, Keyence, SICK, and Omron. We've built controls on Allen-Bradley, Siemens, Beckhoff, and Mitsubishi platforms. We know which brands excel in which applications — and where their limitations are.

**Robot Selection Example:**

A [medical device manufacturer](/industries/medical/) came to us wanting to automate catheter assembly. Their initial plan called for a FANUC LR Mate. Our assessment identified that the process required ±0.02 mm repeatability in a cleanroom environment. We recommended a Mitsubishi RV-series robot instead — it offered ISO Class 5 cleanroom compatibility out of the box and the precision the application demanded, saving them $40,000 in cleanroom modifications.

**Vision System Evaluation:**

Choosing between a Cognex In-Sight 3800 and a Keyence CV-X series isn't just about specs on a datasheet. It's about your lighting conditions, part variability, integration with your PLC platform, and your maintenance team's ability to adjust the system when products change. We evaluate all of those factors.

**What We Assess:**

- Robot brand, model, and payload class for your specific application
- Vision system technology (2D, 3D, line scan) and brand selection
- Control system architecture (standalone PLC, robot-integrated, PC-based)
- Safety system design per RIA 15.06 and ISO 13849
- Communication protocols (EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, EtherCAT)
- End-of-arm tooling approach and vendor selection

### Automation Roadmap Development

An automation roadmap isn't a Gantt chart. It's a strategic document that sequences your automation investments to maximize cumulative ROI while managing risk and resource constraints.

**Our Roadmap Process:**

1. **Current State Assessment** — We document your existing capabilities, identify bottlenecks, and map automation maturity across your operations
2. **Future State Vision** — Where do you need to be in 3-5 years? What does your customer base demand? What are your competitors doing?
3. **Gap Analysis** — The delta between current and future state defines your automation portfolio
4. **Prioritization Matrix** — We score each potential project on ROI, technical risk, strategic importance, and interdependencies
5. **Investment Planning** — Phased capital budgets with contingency built in
6. **Implementation Sequencing** — Which projects build capability for subsequent ones? Where are the dependencies?

We've developed roadmaps for [automotive tier suppliers](/industries/automotive/) planning $20 million in automation over five years, and for small [consumer products](/industries/consumer/) companies investing $500,000 in their first robotic cell. The methodology scales.

## Assessment Services That Uncover Hidden Opportunities

### Manufacturing Assessment

Our manufacturing assessment is a deep dive into your operations. We typically spend 3-5 days on-site, depending on facility size.

**Process Assessment:**

- Detailed cycle time studies (every station, every variant)
- Quality data analysis — where are defects originating?
- Bottleneck identification using constraint theory principles
- Value stream mapping to identify non-value-added steps
- Automation opportunity scoring for each process step

**Equipment Assessment:**

- Existing automation performance vs. original design specs
- Condition-based maintenance evaluation
- Controls obsolescence analysis (if you're still running PLC-5s, we need to talk)
- [Upgrade and retrofit](/services/upgrades-retrofits/) opportunities that extend equipment life

**Facility Assessment:**

- Floor space utilization and material flow analysis
- Utility capacity (compressed air, electrical, cooling)
- Safety and ergonomics review per OSHA guidelines
- Environmental conditions affecting automation (temperature, humidity, vibration)

### Automation Audit

Already have automation that isn't performing? Our audit identifies why and what to do about it.

We've audited systems built by other integrators and found issues ranging from inefficient robot paths (adding 3-4 seconds per cycle) to missing preventive maintenance routines that were causing $200,000 per year in unplanned downtime. One [electronics manufacturer](/industries/electronics/) was running their FANUC robots at 60% speed because a safety scanner was misconfigured — a fix that took 30 minutes and increased throughput by 35%.

### Benchmarking

We compare your automation metrics against industry standards and similar operations:

- **OEE benchmarking** — World-class is 85%+. Most plants we assess are running 55-70%
- **Automation density** — Robots per 10,000 employees vs. industry average
- **Technology generation** — Are your controls and robots current or two generations behind?
- **Best practice gap analysis** — Specific, actionable improvements prioritized by impact

## Real-World Consulting Engagements

### Case 1: Automotive Tier 2 Supplier — Assembly Line Modernization

A brake component manufacturer with 15-year-old assembly equipment was experiencing 22% downtime and 3.8% scrap. Our assessment identified that the controls were obsolete (Allen-Bradley PLC-5 with no spare parts available), the vision system was first-generation smart cameras struggling with new product variants, and the servo press stations had worn ballscrews causing force inconsistency.

**Our recommendation:** A phased modernization approach — controls upgrade first (PLC-5 to ControlLogix, $180K), vision replacement second (Cognex In-Sight upgrade, $95K), then mechanical refurbishment of [servo press](/solutions/servo-pressing/) stations ($220K). Total investment: $495K. Projected savings: $680K annually from reduced downtime and scrap. Payback: 8.7 months.

### Case 2: Medical Device Startup — First Automation Investment

A startup producing a novel surgical instrument needed to scale from hand-built prototypes to 50,000 units per year. They had $750K budgeted for automation and no idea where to start.

Our feasibility study identified that full automation wasn't appropriate for their current product maturity — the design was still iterating. Instead, we recommended semi-automated workstations with manual load/unload and automated process steps ([ultrasonic welding](/solutions/thermal-processing/), vision inspection, and leak testing). This approach cost $480K, left budget for future expansion, and accommodated design changes without major retooling.

### Case 3: Food & Beverage — End-of-Line Automation

A regional snack food manufacturer was manually case-packing and [palletizing](/solutions/palletizing/) 40 SKUs across three production lines. Manual labor turnover was running 120% annually. Our ROI analysis showed a 14-month payback on a $1.2M robotic case packing and palletizing system using FANUC M-410iC robots. The key insight from our consulting engagement: by standardizing case sizes from 12 down to 4, the automation solution became dramatically simpler and more reliable, saving $300K on the original equipment quote.

## Common Challenges We Help You Navigate

**"We don't know what we don't know."** That's the most common thing we hear from prospective clients. Manufacturing leaders know they should be automating, but the landscape is overwhelming. Our consulting creates clarity.

**Unrealistic expectations from equipment vendors.** Robot manufacturers will show you demo videos running at maximum speed with perfect parts. Real production is different. We set expectations based on what actually happens on the factory floor.

**Analysis paralysis.** Some companies study automation for years without pulling the trigger. Our structured approach moves you from analysis to action with confidence.

**Internal resistance to change.** We help you build the business case that gets buy-in from finance, operations, and the shop floor.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much does an automation consulting engagement cost?**
Feasibility studies typically range from $15,000 to $50,000 depending on scope. Comprehensive manufacturing assessments run $25,000 to $75,000. The cost of consulting is typically 2-5% of the total automation investment — and it regularly saves 10-20x that amount by avoiding mistakes.

**How long does a typical consulting engagement take?**
A focused feasibility study takes 4-6 weeks from kickoff to final report. A full manufacturing assessment with roadmap development is typically 8-12 weeks. We can expedite for time-sensitive situations.

**Do we have to use AMD Machines for implementation if we use your consulting services?**
No. Our consulting deliverables are yours to execute with any integrator. That said, most clients continue working with us because we understand their requirements deeply after the consulting phase. There's no obligation either way.

**Can you help us evaluate proposals from other automation integrators?**
Absolutely. We provide independent technical evaluation of vendor proposals, including identifying gaps, risks, and unrealistic claims. Think of it as due diligence for your automation investment.

**What if the feasibility study says we shouldn't automate?**
That happens, and it's valuable information. We've saved clients hundreds of thousands of dollars by identifying processes that aren't ready for automation — and recommending process improvements that need to happen first.

**Do your consultants have hands-on engineering experience?**
Every consultant on our team has designed, built, and commissioned automation systems. We don't employ analysts who've never been on a production floor. Our recommendations come from people who've lived through commissioning and know what works.

**How do we get started?**
[Contact us](/contact/) for an initial conversation. We'll discuss your situation, recommend an appropriate engagement scope, and provide a proposal. There's no cost for the initial discussion.

## Why Choose AMD Machines for Consulting

**We're integrators, not management consultants.** Our recommendations are grounded in what we've actually built and commissioned. When we say a cycle time is achievable, it's because we've hit similar targets on similar applications.

**We're technology-agnostic.** We don't have exclusivity agreements with any robot or controls manufacturer. We recommend what's genuinely best for your application, whether that's a FANUC, ABB, KUKA, Yaskawa, or Universal Robots solution.

**We think about the full lifecycle.** A system that's easy to install but impossible to maintain is a bad system. We consider long-term [maintenance and support](/services/maintenance-support/), spare parts availability, and future flexibility in every recommendation.

**We've done this 2,500+ times.** That experience base is irreplaceable. We've seen what works across [automotive](/industries/automotive/), [medical](/industries/medical/), [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/), [electronics](/industries/electronics/), [food and beverage](/industries/food-beverage/), and [general manufacturing](/industries/general-manufacturing/). Patterns emerge across industries, and we bring those cross-industry insights to every engagement.
