Here's a number that should keep every plant manager awake at night: the average unplanned downtime event in automotive manufacturing costs between $22,000 and $50,000 *per hour*. I've watched a single blown servo drive on a FANUC M-20iA shut down a six-station assembly cell for eleven hours because nobody had a spare on the shelf and the nearest distributor was two states away. That's not a hypothetical — that was a Tuesday in 2019, and the customer lost nearly half a million dollars in production before we got them back online.

After three decades of building, integrating, and servicing over 2,500 automated systems, we've learned one uncomfortable truth: the machine you built last year doesn't care how well you designed it. Without proper maintenance and responsive support, every automation investment is a ticking clock. That's why AMD Machines offers maintenance and support programs engineered with the same precision we put into our [custom automation equipment](/solutions/custom-automation/).

## Why Automation Maintenance Isn't Optional — It's Engineering

A lot of companies treat maintenance like changing the oil in your car. Show up every few months, swap a filter, top off the grease, and call it a day. That approach might work on a sedan, but it'll destroy a $1.2 million robotic welding cell.

Modern automation systems are complex ecosystems. A typical cell we build might include a FANUC R-2000iC robot, a Lincoln Electric Power Wave power source, a Keyence IL-series laser displacement sensor for seam tracking, a Cognex In-Sight 9000 camera for part verification, an Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC orchestrating the whole show, and a dozen pneumatic actuators, grippers, and fixtures tying it all together. Every one of those components has its own maintenance interval, failure mode, and degradation curve.

When you ignore preventive maintenance, you're not just risking a breakdown — you're quietly eroding quality. I've seen robot repeatability drift from ±0.02mm to ±0.15mm over eighteen months because nobody remastered the axes or checked the gear backlash. The parts still looked "fine" to the naked eye, but the scrap rate crept up 3% and nobody connected it back to the robot until we ran a full diagnostic.

## Our Approach: Tiered Support That Actually Works

We've structured our maintenance and support services around how real manufacturing plants actually operate — not some textbook ideal. Every facility is different. A medical device manufacturer running two shifts with [ISO 13485 traceability requirements](/industries/medical/) has completely different needs than an [automotive Tier 1 supplier](/industries/automotive/) running three shifts with just-in-time delivery windows measured in minutes.

### 24/7 Technical Support

When your line goes down at 2 AM on a Saturday, you don't need a voicemail box — you need an engineer who's worked on your exact system. Our technical support operates around the clock, every day of the year.

- **Phone Support** — Immediate access to technicians who average 15+ years in industrial automation. We don't use call center scripts. You'll talk to someone who's programmed FANUC KAREL, configured ABB RobotStudio, and debugged Yaskawa MotoPlus applications firsthand.
- **Remote Diagnostics** — We establish secure VPN connections to your PLC, HMI, and robot controllers. On roughly 40% of emergency calls, we resolve the issue remotely without ever dispatching a truck. That means you're back running in an hour, not a day.
- **Video-Assisted Troubleshooting** — For issues that need eyes on the hardware, we walk your maintenance team through diagnostics and repairs via live video. We've talked floor technicians through servo motor replacements, teach pendant recalibrations, and even safety circuit resets this way.
- **Email and Ticket Support** — For non-emergency issues, we provide detailed technical responses with annotated screenshots, wiring diagrams, and step-by-step procedures.

**Our response commitments:**
- Phone pickup: under 30 minutes, 24/7/365
- Remote connection established: under 1 hour
- On-site technician dispatch: same day or next day depending on contract tier and location

### Emergency Breakdown Service

Production stops are emergencies, and we treat them that way. Our breakdown response follows a proven five-step protocol we've refined over thousands of service calls:

1. **Immediate Triage** — Phone-based assessment to classify the failure. Is it mechanical, electrical, software, or safety-related? We narrow the scope before anyone gets in a van.
2. **Remote Resolution Attempt** — If we can connect remotely, we try to fix it first. We've cleared PLC faults, re-taught robot positions, recalibrated Cognex vision systems, and restored FANUC controller backups — all remotely. About 40% of calls end here.
3. **Technician Dispatch** — When remote doesn't cut it, we send a field technician loaded with the most common failure parts for your system type. No showing up empty-handed.
4. **Emergency Parts Sourcing** — We maintain direct accounts with FANUC, ABB, Yaskawa, KUKA, Omron, Keyence, and every major component supplier. We can get overnight-shipped parts that would take your purchasing department a week to source.
5. **Root Cause Analysis** — Once you're back in production, we don't just close the ticket. We document the failure, identify the root cause, and recommend preventive measures so it doesn't happen again. This step alone has saved customers six figures annually in repeat failures.

## Preventive Maintenance Programs

The best emergency call is the one that never happens. Our preventive maintenance programs are designed around manufacturer specifications, real-world wear data from our 30+ years in the field, and the specific operating conditions of your facility.

### Scheduled Maintenance Cadence

**Daily Checks (Operator-Level)**
- Visual inspection of cable routing, hoses, and connectors
- Safety system verification (E-stops, light curtains, area scanners)
- Fluid and pressure level checks
- Cycle time monitoring for drift detection

**Weekly Maintenance**
- Cleaning of vision system optics and lighting (Cognex, Keyence cameras)
- Connector and terminal block torque verification
- Backup verification of PLC programs and robot positions
- Air pressure and pneumatic system leak checks

**Monthly Service**
- Full mechanical inspection of robot dress packs and cable harnesses
- Lubrication of linear guides, ball screws, and bearings
- Filter replacement on electrical cabinets and cooling systems
- Electrical connection thermal scanning to catch hot spots before they fail
- Software and firmware update assessment

**Annual Overhaul**
- Complete robot mastering and calibration
- Servo motor current signature analysis
- Gearbox oil sampling and replacement
- Safety system validation and documentation per OSHA and ANSI/RIA 15.06
- Full performance benchmark against original commissioning specs

### Robot-Specific Maintenance Protocols

Every robot brand has its quirks, and we've learned them all the hard way. Here's what we focus on for the major platforms:

**FANUC Robots** — Grease replacement on all axes every 3-4 years (or sooner in high-duty-cycle applications). FANUC's grease degradation is the number one cause of unexpected joint failures we see. We also check battery voltages on every visit — a dead backup battery means losing all mastering data, and remastering a six-axis robot takes hours.

**ABB Robots** — Gearbox oil service and calibration verification using ABB's TrueMove and QuickMove parameters. The SMB (Serial Measurement Board) battery on IRB-series robots is critical — if it dies, you lose absolute position data. We replace these proactively on a 2-year cycle.

**KUKA Robots** — Gear lubrication and motor maintenance, with special attention to the absolute encoder calibration on KR-series robots. KUKA's safety system testing is more involved than most brands, and we ensure full KSS (KUKA System Software) compatibility with every update.

**Yaskawa Motoman Robots** — Grease replenishment using Yaskawa's specific grease types (don't mix brands — we've seen that cause catastrophic gear failures). Timing belt inspection on older models, servo tuning for path accuracy, and full functional safety testing.

## Repair and Refurbishment Services

### On-Site Repair
Our field technicians carry diagnostic tools, common replacement parts, and decades of hands-on experience. We repair robots, controllers, servo drives, vision systems, welding power sources, and PLC hardware at your facility.

### Depot Repair
Some components — servo motors, teach pendants, controller boards, welding torches — are better repaired in a controlled shop environment. Ship them to us, and we return them to OEM specifications with full test documentation. Typical turnaround: 5-10 business days, with expedited options available. Common depot repairs include:
- FANUC servo motors (Alpha series) and servo amplifiers
- ABB IRC5 controller modules
- Yaskawa Sigma-series servo drives
- Teach pendants for all brands
- Cognex and Keyence vision cameras and controllers
- Lincoln, Miller, and Fronius welding power sources

### Refurbishment
A full robot refurbishment — disassembly, inspection, worn component replacement, remastering, and performance verification — typically costs 40-60% of a new unit and delivers 90%+ of new-robot performance. For facilities looking to extend the life of existing assets, this is often the smartest investment per dollar spent.

## Specialized Support Services

### Welding System Maintenance
Robotic [welding systems](/solutions/welding/) require specialized knowledge. Wire feeders, torch consumables, gas delivery, and power source maintenance all affect weld quality directly. We service Lincoln Electric, Miller, Fronius, and SKS welding packages integrated with FANUC, ABB, KUKA, and Yaskawa robots.

### Vision System Support
Machine [vision systems](/solutions/machine-vision/) are sensitive instruments in harsh industrial environments. Lens contamination, lighting degradation, and vibration-induced misalignment are the top three causes of false rejects we encounter. Our technicians calibrate and optimize Cognex In-Sight, Keyence CV-X, and Omron FH-series vision platforms.

### Safety System Compliance
We validate safety systems per ANSI/RIA 15.06 and ISO 10218 standards, including safety-rated laser scanners (SICK, Pilz), light curtains, interlock switches, E-stop circuits, and safety PLCs. Full documentation provided for audit readiness.

## Real-World Results: What Proper Maintenance Delivers

**Automotive Tier 1 Supplier — Assembly Line**
A customer running twelve FANUC robots across two [assembly](/solutions/assembly/) lines was averaging 47 hours of unplanned downtime per quarter. We implemented a Standard Service contract with monthly PM visits. Within six months, unplanned downtime dropped to 8 hours per quarter — an 83% reduction. Their OEE went from 72% to 91%.

**Medical Device Manufacturer — Packaging Cell**
A medical packaging line with Yaskawa robots and Cognex vision was experiencing intermittent false rejects that were scrapping 2.4% of good product. Our vision system support team identified LED degradation in the backlight array — a $200 part that was costing them $18,000/month in unnecessary scrap. One PM visit, one part swap, reject rate back to 0.1%.

**Electronics Manufacturer — Test Systems**
An [electronics manufacturer](/industries/electronics/) with automated [test systems](/solutions/test-systems/) was replacing servo motors reactively at $4,500 each, roughly every 14 months. We implemented predictive maintenance using motor current signature analysis. Now we replace motors proactively during planned shutdowns before they fail catastrophically, extending average motor life to 26 months and eliminating the $12,000+ emergency service calls that came with each unplanned failure.

## The ROI of Proactive Maintenance

The numbers consistently prove out:

- **Unplanned downtime reduction:** 70-85% within the first year of a structured PM program
- **Spare parts cost savings:** 15-25% through bulk purchasing agreements and proactive replacement of wear items before they cause collateral damage
- **Equipment lifespan extension:** 30-50% longer useful life compared to run-to-failure approaches
- **OEE improvement:** Typical gains of 8-15 percentage points
- **Quality improvement:** 1-3% reduction in scrap rates related to equipment degradation
- **Payback period:** Most service contracts pay for themselves within 3-6 months through avoided downtime alone

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What robot brands do you service?
We service all major industrial robot platforms including FANUC, ABB, KUKA, Yaskawa Motoman, and Omron (formerly Adept). Our technicians hold manufacturer certifications and attend annual training updates. We also service collaborative robots (cobots) from Universal Robots and FANUC's CRX series.

### How quickly can you respond to an emergency?
Phone response is under 30 minutes, 24/7/365. Remote diagnostic connection is typically established within 1 hour. On-site arrival depends on your location and service tier — Premium contracts include guaranteed 4-hour on-site response within a defined service radius. For Standard contracts, next-business-day on-site service is typical.

### Do you service equipment you didn't build?
Yes. While we obviously know our own systems best, our technicians are experienced with automation equipment from all major integrators. We service standalone robots, turnkey cells, and full production lines regardless of who built them. We perform a system assessment first to understand the equipment before taking on service responsibility.

### What does a preventive maintenance visit include?
It depends on the system and the visit cadence, but a typical quarterly PM includes: mechanical inspection of all moving components, lubrication service, electrical connection checks, safety system verification, backup of all PLC and robot programs, performance data collection, and a written report with findings and recommendations. Annual visits add calibration, oil sampling, and full performance benchmarking.

### Can you help us build an internal maintenance program?
Absolutely. Many of our customers start with a full-service contract and gradually transition to a hybrid model where their internal team handles daily and weekly tasks while we cover monthly, quarterly, and annual service plus emergency support. We provide [training](/services/training/) for your technicians as part of this transition.

### Do you stock spare parts for our systems?
Through our Premium service tier, we maintain a consignment inventory of your most critical spare parts at your facility. For Standard and Basic plans, we maintain recommended spares lists and provide priority access to parts through our OEM relationships. See our [spare parts services](/services/spare-parts/) for more details.

### What's the difference between maintenance and process optimization?
Maintenance keeps your equipment running to its original specifications. [Process optimization](/services/process-optimization/) improves those specifications — faster cycle times, better quality, higher throughput. They're complementary services, and our maintenance team often identifies optimization opportunities during routine visits. Many customers bundle both into a single service agreement.
