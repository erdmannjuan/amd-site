Here's a truth I've learned after three decades in automation: the best-engineered system in the world is only as good as the spare parts program behind it. I've watched a $2.5 million [robotic welding cell](/solutions/welding/) sit dead for nine days because nobody could source a FANUC A06B-6114-H205 servo amplifier. Nine days. At $45,000 per day in lost production, that's over $400,000 in downtime — all because of a $3,800 part that wasn't on the shelf.

At AMD Machines, we've built our spare parts program around one simple philosophy: your line doesn't stop because of a part. With over 30 years of building, integrating, and servicing automated systems — more than 2,500 machines delivered — we know exactly which components fail, when they fail, and what you need on hand to keep running.

## Why Spare Parts Strategy Actually Matters

Most manufacturers treat spare parts as an afterthought. They'll spend months engineering the perfect [assembly system](/solutions/assembly/) and then stock zero critical spares. I can't tell you how many times I've walked into a plant where the maintenance team is scrambling through eBay listings at 2 AM looking for a discontinued servo drive.

Here's what a proper spare parts program actually looks like:

- **Criticality-based stocking** — We analyze your equipment and classify every component by failure probability, lead time, and production impact. A $12 proximity sensor that shuts down a $50,000/hour line? That's a Tier 1 stock item.
- **OEM and qualified aftermarket options** — Not every part needs to be OEM. We'll tell you honestly when an aftermarket alternative is just as reliable at 40-60% of the cost, and when you absolutely need the genuine article.
- **Obsolescence management** — Industrial automation moves fast. Components go end-of-life constantly. We track obsolescence notices from FANUC, ABB, Siemens, Rockwell, and others so you're never caught off guard.
- **Same-day and next-day shipping** — For in-stock critical components, we ship same-day on orders placed before 2 PM EST. Overnight options are available for emergency breakdowns.
- **Technical identification support** — Don't know the part number? Our engineers can identify the failed component from photos, symptoms, or equipment model numbers. We've been inside thousands of machines — we know what we're looking at.

## Robot Spare Parts by Manufacturer

We support all major industrial robot platforms. Here's what we stock and source for each brand:

### FANUC Robot Parts

FANUC dominates North American manufacturing for good reason, and we've been integrating their robots since the R-J2 controller era. Common parts we keep on hand or can source rapidly:

- **Servo motors** (A06B series) — Including the αiF, αiS, and βiS lines. We stock the most failure-prone models like the A06B-0235 and A06B-0238 wrist motors.
- **Servo amplifiers** — A06B-6114, A06B-6117, A06B-6400 series. These are the single biggest cause of unplanned downtime on FANUC systems, and lead times from FANUC can stretch to 8-12 weeks.
- **Teach pendants** — iPendant, iPendant Touch. We carry replacement LCD panels, membrane keypads, cables, and complete units.
- **RV reducers and gearboxes** — Nabtesco and Sumitomo units for J1 through J6 axes. We recommend replacing these proactively at 35,000-45,000 hours rather than waiting for catastrophic failure.
- **Controller boards** — Main CPU, SRAM, FROM/SRAM, I/O boards, and E-Stop boards for R-30iA and R-30iB controllers.
- **Batteries** — Both controller backup batteries and encoder batteries. A dead encoder battery means a full mastering procedure — a $2 battery saves a 4-hour service call.

### ABB Robot Parts

ABB's IRC5 platform is rock-solid, but nothing lasts forever. We supply:

- **Drive units** — DSQC 663, DSQC 639, and current-generation units. The drive module is the most common failure point on older IRC5 systems.
- **FlexPendant components** — Screens, buttons, cables, and USB boards. The joystick module is a frequent wear item in high-use environments.
- **Power supplies** — DSQC 604 and DSQC 609 units for IRC5 cabinets.
- **SMB (Serial Measurement Board)** — Critical for maintaining axis calibration. Failure requires full calibration, which is a multi-hour process.
- **Motor units** — For IRB 2600, IRB 4600, IRB 6700, and other common models.

### KUKA Robot Parts

KUKA's presence in automotive makes their parts critical for Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers:

- **KRC4 controller components** — KPP (power pack), KSP (servo pack), KEB (energy recovery), and CCU (cabinet control unit).
- **RDC boards** — Resolver-to-digital converters fail more often than most people expect, especially in high-vibration environments near [press systems](/solutions/servo-pressing/).
- **SmartPAD** — The KUKA teach pendant. We carry complete units and individual components including LCD panels and connection cables.
- **Motor and gearbox assemblies** — For KR series robots across all payload classes.

### Yaskawa/Motoman Robot Parts

Yaskawa's Motoman line has excellent reliability, but their parts supply chain can be challenging:

- **Servo packs** (SGDV, SGDH series) — The most commonly needed Yaskawa component. We stock popular configurations for DX200 and YRC1000 controllers.
- **Programming pendants** — Standard and high-performance pendant displays and cables.
- **Controller boards** — CPU, JANCD series boards, NIF (network interface), and safety boards.
- **Axis motors** — SGMGV, SGMRV, and SGMSV series for various robot models.

## Automation System Components

Robots are just one part of the equation. A complete [custom automation system](/solutions/custom-automation/) has hundreds of components that need support:

### Controls and Electrical

- **PLCs** — Allen-Bradley ControlLogix/CompactLogix, Siemens S7-1200/1500, Mitsubishi iQ-R, Omron NJ/NX series. We stock processors, I/O modules, communication cards, and power supplies.
- **HMIs** — Allen-Bradley PanelView, Siemens Comfort Panels, Omron NA series. Backlight failures and touchscreen degradation are the most common issues, and we carry replacement panels.
- **Servo drives and motors** — Rockwell Kinetix, Siemens S120, Mitsubishi MR-J5, Yaskawa Sigma-7. We match the exact drive/motor combination to your application.
- **VFDs** — Allen-Bradley PowerFlex, Siemens SINAMICS, ABB ACS series. Common on [material handling](/solutions/material-handling/) conveyors and packaging equipment.
- **Safety components** — Safety relays (Pilz PNOZ, Allen-Bradley Guardmaster), safety light curtains (Keyence GL-R, SICK deTec), E-stop modules, and safety PLCs.

### Sensors and Vision

- **Proximity sensors** — Inductive, capacitive, and photoelectric from Omron, Keyence, Banner, Sick, and Balluff. These are the highest-volume spare part in most plants.
- **Laser sensors** — Keyence IL and IX series, SICK displacement sensors, Micro-Epsilon laser triangulation sensors.
- **Vision system components** — Cognex In-Sight cameras, Keyence CV-X and IV2 series, lenses, lighting controllers, and cables for [machine vision](/solutions/machine-vision/) systems. Camera failures are rare but when they happen, you need a fast replacement.
- **Barcode readers** — Cognex DataMan, Keyence SR series for [marking and traceability](/solutions/marking-traceability/) systems.

### Mechanical and Pneumatic

- **Linear motion** — THK, IKO, and Bosch Rexroth linear guides and bearings. Rail wear and ball bearing fatigue are predictable — we help you set replacement intervals based on actual duty cycles.
- **Ball screws and actuators** — NSK, THK, and SMC electric actuators. We stock standard sizes and can source custom-length ball screws.
- **Pneumatic components** — SMC, Festo, and Parker cylinders, valves, FRL units, and fittings. We carry the most common bore sizes and stroke lengths.
- **End-of-arm tooling** — Schunk, SCHMALZ, Destaco, and ATI tool changers, grippers, vacuum cups, and collision sensors. EOAT components see the most wear of any mechanical part on a robot system.

## Emergency Breakdown Support: When Every Minute Counts

I've taken calls at 3 AM from plant managers whose line just went down. When you're losing $20,000-$80,000 per hour in production, the last thing you need is a phone tree or an email form. Here's how our emergency process works:

1. **Call our parts hotline directly** — You'll reach a technical person, not a receptionist. Our engineers have hands-on experience with every major robot and automation platform.
2. **Rapid fault diagnosis** — Describe the symptoms: error codes, LED patterns, unusual sounds, what happened right before the failure. In many cases, we can identify the failed component over the phone in minutes.
3. **Immediate parts check** — We check our inventory and, if needed, our network of distributor partners across North America. We'll give you honest lead times — no guessing, no "it should be there by Friday."
4. **Expedited shipping** — Same-day courier, next-day air, or hot-shot delivery depending on urgency and distance.
5. **Installation guidance** — Phone support, video call, or [on-site service](/services/maintenance-support/) if you need hands-on help replacing the component.

## Preventive Maintenance Kits: Stop Failures Before They Start

Reactive maintenance is expensive. A FANUC servo motor replacement costs $2,500-$8,000 for the part alone. Add emergency shipping, overtime labor, and lost production, and you're easily looking at $15,000-$50,000 per incident. Compare that to a $3,000-$5,000 annual PM kit that prevents the failure entirely.

We build custom PM kits based on your specific equipment:

- **Robot annual maintenance kits** — Grease, batteries, filters, seals, and wear items matched to your exact robot model and duty cycle. A FANUC M-20iA running two shifts needs different intervals than an M-710iC running one shift.
- **Welding system consumable kits** — Contact tips, nozzles, diffusers, liners, and wire guides for MIG, TIG, and spot welding systems. We bundle these based on your monthly consumption data.
- **Conveyor and material handling kits** — Belts, rollers, bearings, sensors, and drive components sized to your system's throughput and operating hours.
- **Controller maintenance kits** — Fan filters, backup batteries, cooling fans, and cleaning supplies. Controller overheating from clogged filters is one of the most preventable — and most common — failures we see.

We also work with your [maintenance team through our training programs](/services/training/) to ensure PM procedures are followed correctly. A grease gun in untrained hands can do more harm than good — over-greasing a FANUC RV reducer is a real and expensive mistake.

## Obsolete and Hard-to-Find Parts

Industrial automation has an obsolescence problem. Controllers get discontinued, servo drives go end-of-life, and suddenly a perfectly functional $500,000 system can't be repaired because a $1,200 board isn't manufactured anymore.

We handle this in four ways:

- **Last-time-buy alerts** — When we learn a critical component is going end-of-life, we notify affected customers so they can stock up before supply dries up.
- **Certified refurbished parts** — We source, test, and warranty used components. Every refurbished part goes through functional testing on our bench before shipping. We provide a 6-month warranty on refurbished items.
- **Cross-reference and compatible parts** — Many components have compatible alternatives from other manufacturers. We maintain a cross-reference database built from decades of field experience.
- **Retrofit and upgrade paths** — When a part truly can't be replaced, we design [upgrade solutions](/services/upgrades-retrofits/) that bring your equipment to current-generation components. This is often the smartest long-term investment.

## The Business Case for Strategic Spare Parts

Let's talk numbers. Here's what we see across our customer base:

- **Average unplanned downtime cost**: $22,000-$78,000 per hour depending on industry and line value
- **Average time to source an emergency part without a program**: 3-7 business days
- **Average time to source with AMD's spare parts program**: same-day to next-day for critical items
- **Typical spare parts inventory investment**: 1.5-3% of total automation equipment value
- **ROI on preventive spare parts stocking**: 400-800% when measured against avoided downtime costs

One [automotive Tier 1 supplier](/industries/automotive/) we work with calculated that a $47,000 annual spare parts investment prevented an estimated $380,000 in unplanned downtime over 12 months. That's an 8:1 return.

A [medical device manufacturer](/industries/medical/) reduced their mean-time-to-repair from 4.2 days to 6 hours by maintaining a critical spares inventory we helped them define. Their line availability went from 91% to 98.5%.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I determine which spare parts to stock for my automation equipment?

Start with failure mode analysis. We'll review your equipment list, maintenance history, and production criticality to build a prioritized spare parts recommendation. Components with high failure probability, long lead times, and high production impact go on the shelf first. A typical initial stocking program covers 15-25 critical components per major piece of equipment.

### Do you supply OEM parts or aftermarket alternatives?

Both. For safety-critical components — servo drives, safety relays, controller boards — we strongly recommend OEM parts. For sensors, pneumatic components, cables, and mechanical wear items, qualified aftermarket alternatives often perform identically at 40-60% of OEM pricing. We'll always tell you which category a part falls into.

### What's the typical lead time for robot spare parts?

For in-stock items, we ship same-day on orders before 2 PM EST. For non-stock OEM parts, lead times vary: FANUC servo motors and amplifiers currently run 6-12 weeks from the factory. ABB drive units are 4-8 weeks. Yaskawa servo packs are typically 3-6 weeks. These factory lead times are exactly why strategic stocking matters.

### Can you help with parts for older or discontinued robot models?

Yes. We regularly source parts for FANUC R-J3, R-J3iB, and R-30iA systems, ABB S4C+ and IRC5 first-generation controllers, and KUKA KRC2 platforms. Our refurbished parts program and cross-reference database cover most legacy systems still in production. When parts truly aren't available, we design [upgrade and retrofit solutions](/services/upgrades-retrofits/).

### How do your preventive maintenance kits work?

We build kits specific to your equipment models and operating conditions. You tell us what robots and automation you're running, how many shifts, and your current maintenance schedule. We deliver kits on a quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis — your choice. Each kit includes detailed procedures and torque specs so your team can execute PM correctly.

### Do you offer consignment or vendor-managed inventory programs?

Yes, for customers with larger automation fleets (typically 10+ robots or multiple automated lines). We maintain critical spares at your facility or at our warehouse with guaranteed availability. You only pay for parts when you use them, and we handle replenishment automatically. This eliminates the capital burden of spare parts inventory while maintaining fast access.

### What if I don't know the exact part number I need?

That happens more often than you'd think — especially on older equipment where documentation has been lost. Send us photos of the failed component, the equipment model and serial number, any visible part numbers or labels, and a description of the failure symptoms. Our engineers can typically identify the correct replacement from this information. We've been inside thousands of machines over three decades — chances are we've seen your exact system before.
