If there's one area of the factory where I've seen more money wasted than any other, it's end-of-line packaging. And I don't mean wasted on expensive equipment—I mean wasted on labor, rework, and retailer chargebacks because manual packaging can't keep pace with upstream production. I've walked into plants where a $2 million filling line was bottlenecked by six people hand-loading cartons at the end, and the whole operation was only hitting 60% of rated capacity because the packaging couldn't keep up.

At AMD Machines, we've designed and integrated hundreds of packaging systems across [consumer products](/industries/consumer/), [food and beverage](/industries/food-beverage/), [pharmaceutical](/industries/pharmaceutical/), and [electronics](/industries/electronics/) manufacturing. We've learned which technologies actually work at production speed, which robot configurations handle the widest product variety, and how to build changeover flexibility into lines running 15 or 20 SKUs without sacrificing throughput on any of them.

## Why End-of-Line Packaging Is the Bottleneck Nobody Talks About

Here's the pattern we see in nearly every plant assessment. The upstream processes—filling, assembly, molding, whatever makes the product—have been automated and optimized over years of investment. Those machines are running at rated speed with good OEE numbers. Then the product hits the end of the line, and everything slows down.

Manual packaging has three fundamental problems that no amount of training or incentive programs can fix.

**Speed limitations are real.** A skilled manual packer can sustain about 12–15 picks per minute for an 8-hour shift. That's the human limit for repetitive pick-and-place with acceptable ergonomic risk. A FANUC M-10iD robot with a custom end-of-arm tool picks and places 25–40 products per minute, every minute, every shift. And it doesn't slow down at 2 AM.

**Consistency degrades over a shift.** We've measured this. Manual packing defect rates typically run 1–2% at the start of a shift and climb to 4–6% by the end. Misoriented products, incomplete cases, crushed packaging, wrong counts—they all increase as fatigue sets in. Automated systems hold the same defect rate from the first case to the last: typically under 0.3%.

**Changeovers kill throughput on high-mix lines.** When a manual line changes from one product to another, operators need to swap out case blanks, adjust guides, change count patterns, and often wait for a supervisor to verify the setup. We've timed manual changeovers at 15–45 minutes on lines running 10+ SKUs. An automated line with recipe management and servo-driven adjustment completes the same changeover in 1–3 minutes with no tools and no supervisor verification—the system confirms its own setup.

The bottom line: if your packaging operation is still manual and your upstream equipment has capacity headroom, automated packaging is almost certainly the highest-ROI investment you can make right now.

## Packaging Technologies: What Actually Works at Production Speed

We've integrated every major packaging technology and equipment platform on the market. Here's what we've learned about each one—the good, the limitations, and where each technology fits best.

### Cartoning Systems

Cartoning is the workhorse of primary packaging—loading products into folding cartons for retail display or secondary packaging. We integrate both horizontal and vertical cartoners depending on your product and speed requirements.

**Horizontal cartoners** load products from the side into pre-erected cartons. We integrate Bosch (now Syntegon), Marchesini, and IWK horizontal cartoners at speeds from 60 to 300 cartons per minute. These machines handle the widest range of product types—bottles, blisters, pouches, trays, and bags—and they're the right choice when products arrive horizontally on a conveyor.

**Vertical cartoners** (top-load) erect a carton, drop or push the product in from the top, and close the flaps. They're the better choice for fragile products that can't be pushed sideways or for bags and pouches that conform to the carton shape when loaded from the top. We see vertical cartoners most often in [food and beverage](/industries/food-beverage/) and pharmaceutical applications.

For lower-speed operations (under 40 cartons per minute), we often replace mechanical cartoners with robotic carton loading using a FANUC M-2iA or ABB IRB 360 FlexPicker delta robot. The robot picks the product from a conveyor, orients it with a vision system, and places it into an erected carton. This approach costs less than a dedicated cartoning machine and handles product variety far better—you change the product by loading a new robot program, not by retooling a mechanical cartoner.

### Case Packing and Case Erecting

Secondary packaging—loading cartons, bottles, pouches, or products into corrugated cases—is where robotic automation delivers the biggest flexibility advantage.

**Robotic case packing** with FANUC M-710iC or ABB IRB 6700 series robots handles the widest product range with the fastest changeover. The robot picks a product or group of products with a vacuum or mechanical gripper, places them into an erected case in the programmed pattern, and a downstream case sealer closes the flaps. Changing from a 4x3 pack pattern to a 3x2 pattern is a recipe selection at the HMI—no mechanical adjustment.

**Mechanical case packers** (drop packers, side-load packers, wrap-around formers) run faster than robots on dedicated, high-volume lines. We integrate Pearson, Combi, and Wexxar case packers at speeds up to 35 cases per minute. These machines are the right choice when you're running one or two pack patterns at high speed without frequent changeover.

**Case erecting** is a critical upstream operation that has to keep pace with the packer. We integrate Combi, Lantech, and Wexxar case erectors with hot-melt or tape bottom sealing. A properly tuned case erector runs at 25–40 cases per minute and reliably handles case blanks from major corrugated suppliers. We set up blank magazines that hold 200+ blanks to minimize operator attention.

### Wrapping and Bundling Systems

Tertiary packaging protects cases and products for shipping and warehousing.

**Stretch wrapping** for pallets is almost always the final step before the warehouse. We integrate Lantech, Wulftec, and Orion stretch wrappers—both turntable and rotary arm styles. Turntable wrappers handle loads up to 4,000 lbs and wrap 30–40 pallets per hour. Rotary arm wrappers handle unstable loads that can't be rotated and are the standard for high-speed lines at 50+ pallets per hour.

**Shrink wrapping** bundles products into multipacks or provides tamper-evident overwrap. We integrate Texwrap and Shanklin L-bar and continuous-motion shrink systems at speeds up to 60 packs per minute. For beverage and consumer goods multipacks, shrink bundling is often more cost-effective than corrugated case packing.

**Banding and strapping** systems from Signode and Mosca secure cases to pallets or bundle products together. We integrate inline strapping at line speed—typically adding less than 2 seconds per case to the cycle time.

## Vision Systems: The Brains Behind Modern Packaging

If you build a packaging line without [machine vision](/solutions/machine-vision/), you're building a line that can't verify its own work. Every packaging system we deliver includes at least one vision checkpoint, and most include three or four.

### Product Orientation and Inspection

Before a product goes into a carton, a Cognex In-Sight 2800 or Keyence CV-X camera verifies orientation, label position, and product integrity. On a recent [consumer products](/industries/consumer/) line, we installed a Cognex camera at the infeed conveyor that checks label orientation within ±2 degrees and rejects any bottle with a misaligned or missing label before it reaches the cartoner. That single camera eliminated 100% of the misoriented-label complaints from the retailer—which had been costing the customer $45,000/year in chargebacks.

### Case Content Verification

After products are loaded into a case and before the case sealer closes the flaps, a top-mounted camera verifies the correct count, pattern, and product type. This catches missing products, wrong SKUs in mixed cases, and products that shifted during transport from the loading station. We use Keyence CV-X series cameras with custom lighting to image case contents regardless of product color or finish.

### Label and Code Verification

Every case, carton, and pallet needs correct labeling for the supply chain. We integrate Cognex DataMan barcode readers and Keyence SR-X series scanners to verify barcodes, lot codes, date codes, and serialized identifiers on every package. For [pharmaceutical](/industries/pharmaceutical/) serialization applications, we integrate track-and-trace systems that assign, verify, and aggregate serial numbers from unit dose through pallet—meeting FDA Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) requirements.

## Real-World Application Examples

### Consumer Goods: Multi-SKU Variety Pack Assembly

A major consumer goods manufacturer needed to assemble variety packs containing 4 different product SKUs from 4 separate production lines. Manual assembly required 8 operators per shift, changeover between variety pack configurations took 30 minutes, and wrong-SKU errors were running at 1.8%—generating retailer chargebacks averaging $12,000 per month.

We designed a system with four FANUC M-2iA delta robots, each picking products from a dedicated infeed conveyor. A Cognex In-Sight 3800 camera on each line identifies the product SKU by label and color before the robot picks it. A fifth camera verifies the completed variety pack contents before the case sealer. Recipe management at the HMI allows the operator to select from 12 variety pack configurations—changeover completes in 90 seconds.

**Results:** 22 variety packs per minute (up from 8 manual), wrong-SKU errors reduced to zero in 14 months of production, headcount reduced from 8 to 1 operator per shift. The system paid for itself in 9 months on a two-shift operation. Annual labor savings: $420,000. Annual chargeback elimination: $144,000.

### Pharmaceutical: Serialized Blister Pack Cartoning

A [pharmaceutical](/industries/pharmaceutical/) contract manufacturer needed to carton serialized blister packs at 150 cartons per minute while meeting FDA DSCSA track-and-trace requirements. Each blister pack receives a unique serial number, the carton receives a matching serial number, and the system must aggregate serial numbers as cartons are packed into cases and cases are palletized—creating a complete parent-child hierarchy for every dose.

We integrated a Marchesini MA 305 horizontal cartoner with a Cognex DataMan 370 series verification system. A FANUC LR Mate 200iD robot loads rejected blisters into quarantine while the line continues running at full speed. The serialization system writes serial numbers to each blister and carton via UV laser, verifies readability of every code, and aggregates serial data automatically as cartons enter cases and cases enter pallets.

**Results:** 155 cartons per minute sustained (exceeding the 150 CPM target), 99.97% first-pass serialization yield, full DSCSA compliance verified during FDA audit. The system handles 6 different blister configurations with recipe changeover under 4 minutes. Serialization data integrates with the customer's ERP system for complete lot genealogy.

### Food & Beverage: High-Speed Snack Bar Case Packing

A snack food manufacturer needed to case pack individually wrapped snack bars into retail display cases and shipper cases at 400 bars per minute from two parallel flow wrappers. The existing manual operation couldn't keep pace—bars were backing up on the conveyor and falling off the end, creating waste and a housekeeping nightmare.

We designed a two-robot cell with ABB IRB 360 FlexPicker delta robots, each servicing one flow wrapper output. The robots pick bars from a belt conveyor using vacuum grippers and place them into cases on a servo-indexed case conveyor. A Keyence CV-X camera tracks bar positions on the belt at 30 frames per second, feeding coordinates to the ABB PickMaster software for dynamic picking. A Combi CE-25 case erector feeds empty cases at 30 cases per minute.

**Results:** 420 bars per minute sustained (105% of target), zero product waste from conveyor overflow, changeover between 12-count retail and 48-count shipper cases in 2 minutes. The system handles bar lengths from 100 mm to 180 mm without mechanical adjustment—the robot program and gripper accommodate the range. Operator headcount dropped from 6 per shift to 1.

## The ROI of Automated Packaging

Let me walk through the numbers we see most often. Packaging automation ROI comes from four buckets, and customers who only calculate the first one underestimate their payback by 40–60%.

**Direct labor savings** are the obvious win. End-of-line packaging is one of the most labor-intensive operations in manufacturing. A typical manual packaging line requires 4–8 operators per shift at a fully burdened cost of $55,000–$65,000 per operator per year. An automated line typically requires 1 operator for monitoring, material loading, and exception handling. On a two-shift operation replacing 6 manual packers, you're saving $330,000–$390,000 per year.

**Throughput gains** are the multiplier. If your packaging line is the bottleneck, automating it unlocks capacity in every upstream process. We've seen plants increase total output by 25–40% simply by uncorking the packaging bottleneck—with zero additional investment in upstream equipment. At typical product margins, that incremental output is worth $200,000–$500,000 per year.

**Quality cost reduction** adds up faster than people expect. Retailer chargebacks for packaging defects—wrong counts, damaged products, misaligned labels, incorrect codes—typically run $50,000–$200,000/year for manual operations. Vision-verified automated packaging drops these costs to near zero. For pharmaceutical manufacturers, the regulatory cost of a packaging error can be orders of magnitude higher.

**Changeover efficiency** is the hidden benefit on high-mix lines. If you're losing 30 minutes per changeover and changing over 3 times per shift on a two-shift operation, that's 3 hours of lost production per day—15 hours per week. At even modest line output values, that lost time is worth $100,000–$300,000/year. Cutting changeovers from 30 minutes to 3 minutes recovers most of that capacity.

A typical robotic packaging cell costs $200,000–$400,000. A complete end-of-line system with cartoning, case packing, and [palletizing](/solutions/palletizing/) runs $400,000–$800,000. We consistently see **full payback in 8–14 months** on two-shift operations.

## Common Challenges and How We Solve Them

**"We run 15+ SKUs on one line and can't afford long changeovers."** This is the number one driver for robotic packaging over mechanical packaging. A robot changes products by loading a new program—typically under 2 minutes including HMI recipe selection and servo-driven adjustment of guides, stops, and case erector. Mechanical machines often need physical tool changes. We design systems around recipe management from day one, and we test every SKU during the factory acceptance test.

**"Our products are fragile and get damaged during packaging."** Product damage usually comes from two sources: excessive grip force during pick-and-place, and impact during case loading. We solve grip force with force-limited vacuum grippers or servo-controlled mechanical grippers that adjust to product compliance. For case loading, we use controlled-descent placement rather than drop loading—the robot places the product gently to the bottom of the case rather than releasing it from above. On a recent electronics packaging line, product damage dropped from 2.1% to 0.05% after automation.

**"We need to mix different products in the same case."** Mixed-case and variety-pack assembly is where [robotic cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/) truly excel. Each robot picks from a dedicated product infeed, and the cell controller coordinates placement into shared cases according to the pack recipe. Vision verification confirms the correct product mix before sealing. We've built systems assembling 18 different variety pack configurations on a single line.

**"Our upstream production rate varies throughout the shift."** Real production lines don't run at constant speed. We design accumulation buffers between production and packaging that absorb rate variations—typically 5–15 minutes of product buffer using spiral conveyors or mass-flow accumulators. The packaging system monitors buffer level and adjusts speed automatically, preventing both starvation and overflow.

**"We need packaging data integrated with our ERP/WMS system."** Every packaging system we build includes an Allen-Bradley or Siemens PLC with Ethernet/IP or PROFINET connectivity. We provide OPC UA data interfaces that feed production counts, changeover events, reject counts, and OEE data directly to your plant historian or ERP system. For [pharmaceutical](/industries/pharmaceutical/) applications, we integrate electronic batch records and serialization data per 21 CFR Part 11 requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What packaging speeds can automated systems achieve?

It depends heavily on the packaging format and product. Cartoning systems run 60–300 cartons per minute. Robotic case packing typically achieves 15–30 cases per minute per robot, depending on pack pattern and product size. Delta robots for pick-and-place sustain 100–150 picks per minute. Case erectors run 25–40 cases per minute. We specify and validate speeds during the design phase and guarantee them contractually during the factory acceptance test.

### How do you handle product changeover on high-mix lines?

Recipe-driven automation is the key. All servo-driven adjustments—conveyor guides, case erector format, carton size, robot pick-and-place programs, vision inspection parameters—are stored as recipes in the PLC. The operator selects the new product at the HMI, and the system automatically adjusts everything. For lines running 10+ SKUs, we typically achieve changeover in 1–3 minutes with zero tools. We verify every recipe during the FAT so the customer sees actual changeover performance before shipment.

### Can you integrate packaging with our existing production line?

This is how most of our packaging projects work. We survey your existing line, measure conveyor heights and speeds, document control system interfaces, and design the packaging system to bolt onto your existing infrastructure. We prefer to control the packaging system with its own PLC and HMI, interfacing with your upstream equipment via Ethernet/IP or hardwired I/O for start/stop, fault, and product-present signals. This approach minimizes disruption to your existing controls.

### What maintenance do automated packaging systems require?

Robotic packaging systems are relatively low maintenance. FANUC and ABB robots need grease changes every 3–5 years (or at interval per their maintenance schedule). Conveyor belts, vacuum cups, and case erector wear parts need periodic replacement—we provide a recommended spare parts list and maintenance schedule with every system. Most customers budget 2–4 hours per week of preventive maintenance time. We also offer ongoing [maintenance and support](/services/maintenance-support/) contracts for customers who prefer to outsource PM.

### How do you verify package quality at production speed?

Every system includes [machine vision](/solutions/machine-vision/) checkpoints appropriate for the application. Typical checks include: product presence and orientation before loading (Cognex In-Sight or Keyence CV-X cameras), case content verification after loading (top-mounted camera), barcode and date code verification (Cognex DataMan or Keyence SR-X readers), and seal integrity verification (vision or sensor-based). Rejected packages are automatically diverted without stopping the line. All inspection data is logged for quality traceability.

### What's the difference between robotic and mechanical packaging?

Mechanical packaging machines (cartoners, case packers, wrappers) use cams, linkages, and servo mechanisms purpose-built for a specific packaging format. They're faster on dedicated lines—a mechanical cartoner runs 200+ CPM while a robot tops out around 40 CPM. Robotic systems are more flexible—changing product format is a program change, not a mechanical retool. We recommend mechanical systems for high-speed, low-mix applications and robotic systems for lower-speed, high-mix applications. Many of our lines combine both: a mechanical cartoner for high-speed primary packaging feeding a robotic case packer for flexible secondary packaging.

### Do you handle sanitary and washdown packaging applications?

Yes. For [food and beverage](/industries/food-beverage/) packaging, we build systems with stainless steel frames, IP65/IP67-rated components, FANUC and ABB washdown-rated robots, and sloped surfaces for drainage. Materials in the product contact zone are FDA-compliant, and the system design follows USDA sanitary guidelines. We've integrated packaging systems in USDA-inspected facilities handling ready-to-eat products with daily high-pressure washdown requirements.
