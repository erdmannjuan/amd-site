Marking and traceability systems provide permanent part identification and complete genealogy tracking. AMD Automation integrates marking technologies with your production systems to ensure every part can be traced through its entire lifecycle.

## Marking Technologies

### Laser Marking

Permanent, high-contrast marks:

- **Fiber lasers** - Metals and some plastics
- **CO2 lasers** - Organics, glass, some plastics
- **UV lasers** - Sensitive materials, fine detail
- **Green lasers** - Reflective metals, copper

### Dot Peen Marking

Deep, durable marks for harsh environments:

- Permanent indentation in material
- Readable after paint and coating
- Suitable for castings and forgings
- Pneumatic and electric systems

### Inkjet Marking

High-speed, non-contact marking:

- Continuous inkjet for production speeds
- Drop-on-demand for precision
- Multiple ink types and colors
- Suitable for porous and non-porous surfaces

### Label Application

When direct marking is not suitable:

- Pressure-sensitive labels
- RFID tag application
- Print and apply systems
- Tamper-evident labels

## Code Types

Support for all standard formats:

- **1D Barcodes** - Code 128, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5
- **2D Codes** - Data Matrix, QR Code, PDF417
- **Human Readable** - Serial numbers, date codes, lot numbers
- **Logos and Graphics** - Company marks and symbols

## Verification Systems

Ensure mark quality with:

- **[Machine Vision](/solutions/machine-vision/)** - Read and grade every code
- **Verification standards** - ISO 15415, ISO 15416 compliance
- **Database validation** - Confirm unique serialization

## System Integration

Traceability systems connect your operations:

- **MES Integration** - Exchange data with manufacturing systems
- **ERP Connection** - Link to enterprise resource planning
- **Quality Systems** - Record inspection results by serial
- **[Test Systems](/solutions/test-systems/)** - Associate test data with parts

## Industry Applications

- **[Automotive](/industries/automotive/)** - VIN, component serialization, AIAG compliance
- **[Medical](/industries/medical/)** - UDI compliance, device tracking
- **[Aerospace](/industries/aerospace/)** - FAA part marking requirements
- **[Electronics](/industries/electronics/)** - PCB traceability, component tracking
