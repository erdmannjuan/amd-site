Robotic palletizing automates the demanding task of building and breaking down pallets at production line speeds. AMD Machines designs palletizing systems that integrate with your packaging lines for efficient end-of-line operations.

## Palletizing Configurations

### Single-Line Palletizers

Dedicated palletizer for one production line:

- Compact footprint
- High speed for uniform products
- Simple integration
- Cost-effective automation

### Multi-Line Palletizers

One robot serves multiple production lines:

- Maximize robot utilization
- Handle different products from each line
- Efficient floor space usage
- Scalable capacity

### Hybrid Layer/Pick Systems

Combine layer forming with individual case picking:

- Handle both uniform and mixed loads
- Flexible for changing requirements
- Optimize speed and flexibility

## Gripper Technologies

Match the gripper to your product:

- **Vacuum grippers** - Cases, trays, bags
- **Clamp grippers** - Rigid cases and cartons
- **Fork grippers** - Layer handling
- **Magnetic grippers** - Steel containers

## Integration with Packaging Lines

Palletizing connects to:

- **[Material Handling](/solutions/material-handling/)** - Conveyors and AGVs
- **Case packing equipment** - Cartoners and case erectors
- **Stretch wrapping** - Pallet wrap systems
- **Warehouse systems** - WMS integration

## Industry Applications

- **[Food & Beverage](/industries/food-beverage/)** - Cases, trays, bags
- **[Consumer Products](/industries/consumer/)** - Packaged goods
- **[Pharmaceutical](/industries/pharmaceutical/)** - Cases and shippers
- **[General Manufacturing](/industries/general-manufacturing/)** - Finished goods
