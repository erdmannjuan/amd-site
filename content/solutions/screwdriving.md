Automated screwdriving systems ensure consistent, traceable fastening in high-volume [assembly operations](/solutions/assembly/). AMD Automation designs screwdriving cells that integrate torque control, automatic feeding, and verification for reliable fastening.

## Screwdriving System Components

### Feeding Systems

Reliable screw delivery is critical:

- Bowl feeders for high-volume single screw types
- Stick magazines for quick changeover
- Flexible feeders for mixed fastener handling
- Blow-feed tubes for remote delivery to spindle

### Spindle Technology

Modern spindles provide precise control:

- DC electric spindles with torque/angle monitoring
- Pneumatic clutch drivers for simple applications
- Fixtured multi-spindle heads for simultaneous fastening
- Robotic spindles for flexible positioning

### Control and Verification

Every fastening operation is monitored:

- Real-time torque and angle curves
- Pass/fail determination against specifications
- Automatic reject handling
- Data logging for traceability

## Integration with Assembly Lines
