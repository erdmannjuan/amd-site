Servo press systems provide precise force and position control for [assembly operations](/solutions/assembly/) requiring verified pressing. AMD Machines designs servo press stations that ensure consistent, traceable press-fit assembly.

## Servo Press Technology

### Force-Position Control

Unlike pneumatic or hydraulic presses, servo presses provide:

- Programmable force vs. position profiles
- Real-time monitoring throughout the stroke
- Adjustable approach, pressing, and hold phases
- Signature analysis for process verification

### Signature Monitoring

Every press operation generates a force-position curve:

- Compare actual curve to reference envelope
- Detect part variation, misalignment, or damage
- Pass/fail determination in real-time
- Store complete curve data for traceability

### Capacity Options

Servo presses scale to your application:

- Light duty: 1-10 kN for electronics and small parts
- Medium duty: 10-100 kN for automotive and appliance
- Heavy duty: 100+ kN for powertrain and heavy components

## Integration with Automation

Servo pressing integrates with complete assembly systems:

- **[Robotic Cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/)** - Robot loads parts to press fixtures
- **[Assembly Lines](/solutions/assembly/)** - Inline pressing stations
- **[Machine Vision](/solutions/machine-vision/)** - Verify part presence before pressing
- **[Test Systems](/solutions/test-systems/)** - Press testing for quality verification

## Industry Applications

- **[Automotive](/industries/automotive/)** - Bearing, seal, and bushing installation
- **[Medical](/industries/medical/)** - Precision device assembly
- **[Electronics](/industries/electronics/)** - Connector and component pressing
- **[Appliances](/industries/appliances/)** - Motor and valve assembly
