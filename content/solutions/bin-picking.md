Robotic bin picking combines 3D vision, AI algorithms, and precise robot control to automatically pick randomly oriented parts from bins and containers. AMD Automation designs bin picking systems that integrate with your [machine tending](/solutions/machine-tending/), [assembly](/solutions/assembly/), and [material handling](/solutions/material-handling/) operations.

## How Bin Picking Works

### 3D Vision Scanning

Structured light or laser sensors create a 3D point cloud of the bin contents:

- Identify individual parts in cluttered scenes
- Determine exact position and orientation
- Calculate optimal grasp points
- Detect bin walls and obstacles

### AI-Powered Planning

Intelligent algorithms process vision data:

- Select the best part to pick based on accessibility
- Plan collision-free robot paths
- Optimize gripper approach angles
- Handle part-to-part variation

### Precise Robot Execution

The robot executes the planned pick:

- Sub-millimeter positioning accuracy
- Force-controlled gripping
- Smooth extraction from bin
- Reliable placement for downstream operations

## Integration Options

Bin picking integrates with existing automation:

- **[Robotic Cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/)** - Add bin picking to existing work cells
- **[Machine Tending](/solutions/machine-tending/)** - Feed CNC machines from bulk containers
- **[Assembly Lines](/solutions/assembly/)** - Eliminate bowl feeders for complex parts
- **[Palletizing](/solutions/palletizing/)** - Depalletize mixed SKUs

## Applications by Industry

- **[Automotive](/industries/automotive/)** - Castings, stampings, machined components
- **[Heavy Equipment](/industries/heavy-equipment/)** - Large forgings and fabricated parts
- **[Consumer Products](/industries/consumer/)** - Packaged goods and components
- **[General Manufacturing](/industries/general-manufacturing/)** - Any bulk-stored parts
