After more than three decades and over 2,500 machines shipped, we've learned something that most automation brochures won't tell you: the hardest part of assembly automation isn't picking the right robot or designing a clever fixture. It's understanding *your* product well enough to build a machine that runs lights-out on second shift without a single quality escape. That's what AMD Machines does—and it's all we've done since day one.

## Why Custom Assembly Automation Matters

If you're still running a manual assembly line, you already know the pain. Operator turnover, inconsistent torque values, missed components, and the constant pressure to ship more parts with fewer people. Off-the-shelf assembly equipment can handle simple tasks, but the moment your product has tight tolerances, multiple variants, or regulatory traceability requirements, you need a purpose-built machine.

Custom assembly automation isn't just about replacing hands with grippers. It's about engineering a process that's *better* than what a skilled operator can do—faster, more repeatable, and self-auditing. When we build an [assembly system](/solutions/assembly/), every station is designed around your specific part geometry, cycle time target, and quality requirements.

The numbers speak for themselves. Across our installed base, customers typically see:

- **40–60% reduction** in direct labor costs
- **3–5x increase** in throughput per square foot
- **Sub-1% scrap rates** on previously 3–5% manual lines
- **Full payback** in 14–24 months depending on shift utilization

## Automated Assembly Line Configurations

Picking the right machine architecture is the single most important decision in an assembly automation project. Get it wrong and you're stuck with a machine that can't hit rate, can't accommodate your next product variant, or costs twice what it should. Here's how we think about it.

### Rotary Dial Machines

Rotary dial systems are the workhorses of high-volume assembly. A central indexing table—typically driven by a Weiss or Colombo Filippetti cam unit—carries nests through 8 to 24 stations arranged around the dial's perimeter. Every index, all stations execute simultaneously. That parallel processing is what makes dials so fast.

We've built rotary dials running at 40+ parts per minute on automotive connector assemblies, and others running at 6 parts per minute on complex medical devices with 15+ assembly operations. The sweet spot is products smaller than about 200 mm that need 6–16 distinct operations.

**When to choose a dial:** High volume (250K+ parts/year), small-to-medium parts, relatively stable product design, and cycle times under 6 seconds per part.

### Linear Transfer Systems

Linear transfer—sometimes called walking-beam or pallet transfer—moves workpiece carriers through a straight or loop-shaped sequence of stations. Each station performs one or more operations, and the pallet advances when the slowest station finishes.

We typically use Bosch Rexroth TS 2plus or TS 5 transfer systems for medium-duty applications and custom-built heavy-duty conveyors for products over 10 kg. The big advantage of linear systems is scalability: need to add an operation? Insert a new station. Need to buffer between a fast upstream and a slow downstream? Add accumulation.

**When to choose linear transfer:** Larger products, longer cycle times (6–30 seconds), frequent product changes, or when you expect to add operations over the machine's life.

### Flexible Robotic Assembly Cells

When your volumes don't justify a dedicated dial or transfer line—or when you're assembling dozens of variants on the same line—robotic cells give you the flexibility to adapt. A typical cell pairs a FANUC LR Mate 200iD or ABB IRB 1200 with a vision-guided part presentation system and quick-change tooling.

We've deployed robotic cells using FANUC's iRVision integrated vision and Cognex In-Sight cameras for part location, allowing the robot to pick components from random orientations without dedicated fixturing. Combined with Schunk quick-change couplers, a single cell can switch between product families in under two minutes.

**When to choose robotic cells:** Mixed-model production, lower volumes (under 250K/year), frequent product introductions, or when you need the same system to handle assembly, inspection, and packaging. Learn more about our [robotic cell capabilities](/solutions/robotic-cells/).

## Assembly Automation Equipment & Operations

### Press-Fit and Interference Joining

Press-fit is one of the most common—and most misunderstood—assembly operations. We integrate servo-electric presses from Promess, Kistler, and Schmidt ranging from 0.5 kN to 50 kN. The key isn't just hitting a force target; it's monitoring the entire force-displacement curve in real time.

A properly tuned servo press system captures the signature of every press operation, comparing it against upper and lower envelopes. We've caught incoming material changes, plating thickness variations, and fixture wear issues before they produced a single bad part—just from shifts in the press curve.

### Multi-Spindle Screwdriving

For fastening operations, we integrate Atlas Copco, Desoutter, and Weber automatic screwdriving systems. Multi-spindle configurations drive 2–8 screws simultaneously, and every spindle monitors torque and angle to confirm proper seating.

On a recent [consumer products](/industries/consumer/) line, we designed a 6-spindle screwdriving station that completes all fastening operations in a single 2.8-second cycle—down from 45 seconds of manual assembly per unit. The system feeds screws from a Stöger rail system and verifies every joint with torque-angle monitoring.

### Precision Dispensing

Adhesive, sealant, and grease [dispensing](/solutions/dispensing/) operations demand tight process control. We integrate Nordson EFD, Graco, and Scheugenpflug systems with volumetric or time-pressure control, and we always include bead inspection—either vision-based or sensor-based—to verify material placement.

### Vision-Guided Assembly

Modern assembly machines rely heavily on [machine vision](/solutions/machine-vision/) for part location, orientation verification, and post-assembly inspection. We're experienced with Cognex In-Sight and VisionPro platforms, Keyence CV-X and XG-X series, and FANUC iRVision integrated vision. On a recent electronics assembly line, we used a Keyence XG-X system running at 120 fps to inspect solder joint quality on every unit—catching defects that escaped manual inspection for years.

## Part Feeding: The Make-or-Break Subsystem

Here's a war story that illustrates why part feeding matters more than most people think. Early in my career, we built a beautiful 16-station dial machine for an automotive client. Gorgeous controls, rock-solid mechanical design, flawless station-to-station timing. And it sat at 60% OEE for three months because the bowl feeders couldn't reliably orient a tiny spring clip.

We eventually replaced the bowls with an Asyril Asycube flex feeder paired with a Cognex vision system, and the machine jumped to 92% OEE overnight. Lesson learned: never underestimate part feeding.

Today, we evaluate every component and select the right feeding approach:

- **Vibratory bowl feeders** — Still the best choice for simple, symmetrical parts at high rates. We work with RNA, Automation Devices, and Service Engineering.
- **Centrifugal feeders** — Excellent for small, lightweight parts that need gentle handling (medical components, o-rings, rubber seals).
- **Flex feeders with vision** — The go-to for complex geometries, fragile parts, or frequent changeovers. Asyril Asycube and FlexiBowl systems paired with vision.
- **Magazine and tray systems** — For larger or pre-oriented components, especially in [electronics](/industries/electronics/) and medical device assembly.
- **Escapement mechanisms** — Simple, reliable, and often the best solution for tube-fed or rail-fed components.

## Error Proofing and Quality Assurance

Every AMD assembly machine ships with multiple layers of poka-yoke and in-process quality verification. We don't just check the final product—we verify every operation as it happens.

### Station-Level Verification

- **Presence sensors** confirm components are loaded before the cycle starts
- **Force-displacement monitoring** on every press and insertion operation
- **Torque-angle verification** on every fastening operation
- **Vision inspection** of critical features, bead placement, label position, and component orientation
- **Leak and flow testing** integrated directly into the assembly sequence when required ([learn more about our test systems](/solutions/test-systems/))

### System-Level Quality Management

- **SPC data collection** with real-time Cpk trending on critical parameters
- **Reject segregation** with locked reject bins and part-level traceability
- **Barcode and RFID tracking** for serialized product genealogy
- **MES integration** via OPC UA, MQTT, or direct database writes

We've built systems that meet FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records in [medical device manufacturing](/industries/medical/), IATF 16949 traceability requirements for [automotive](/industries/automotive/) Tier 1 suppliers, and AS9100 documentation standards for [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/) hardware. See all the [industries we serve with automation equipment](/industries/).

## Real-World Application Examples

### Automotive HVAC Actuator Assembly

A Tier 1 automotive supplier needed to assemble a multi-component HVAC blend door actuator at 1,200 units per hour. The product contained a DC motor, gear train, position sensor, PCB, housing halves, and six self-tapping screws.

We built a 20-station rotary dial machine with servo-controlled press stations, ultrasonic welding, automated screwdriving, and end-of-line electrical testing. The system uses FANUC iRVision for gear mesh verification and a Keyence laser displacement sensor for weld height inspection.

**Results:** 3.0-second cycle time, 98.5% first-pass yield (up from 94% manual), zero customer PPM complaints in the first 18 months of production. Full payback in 16 months running two shifts.

### Medical Inhaler Device Assembly

A medical device OEM required a fully validated system for assembling a metered-dose inhaler with complete lot traceability. The line needed to handle three product variants with tool-less changeover.

We designed a linear transfer system with 14 stations, including ultrasonic welding, dose-weight verification, leak testing, and 2D barcode serialization. The entire system operates in a Class 100K clean room with stainless steel construction and FDA 21 CFR Part 11-compliant data recording.

**Results:** 22 units per minute, IQ/OQ/PQ validation completed in 12 weeks, electronic batch records for every unit produced. The system replaced a 12-person manual line and paid for itself in 11 months.

### Electronics Sensor Module Assembly

A sensor manufacturer needed to assemble a multi-layer sensor stack with ±0.02 mm placement accuracy. The product required precision adhesive dispensing, UV curing, and automated electrical testing at each stage.

We built a hybrid system combining a FANUC LR Mate 200iD/7L robot with a precision linear stage for placement and a Nordson EFD dispensing system for sub-microliter adhesive dots. Cognex VisionPro guided every placement, and a custom fixture maintained alignment through the UV cure cycle.

**Results:** ±0.015 mm actual placement accuracy (better than spec), 15-second cycle time, and a 60% reduction in adhesive waste compared to manual dispensing.

## Assembly Automation ROI & Cost Analysis

Let's talk numbers, because that's what your CFO cares about. Here's a simplified ROI framework we use during concept development:

**Direct labor savings** are usually the largest contributor. If your manual line has 6 operators per shift at a fully burdened cost of $55,000/year each, that's $330,000/year per shift. A two-shift operation spends $660,000/year on direct labor. An automated system monitored by one operator saves $440,000–$550,000/year in labor alone.

**Quality cost reduction** is the second-biggest driver. If your current scrap rate is 3% on a product with $8 in material cost, and you're producing 500,000 units per year, that's $120,000/year in scrap. Dropping to 0.5% scrap saves $100,000/year. Add in the cost of customer returns, sorting, and warranty claims, and quality savings often exceed $150,000/year.

**Throughput improvement** is sometimes the entire justification. If you're capacity-constrained and losing orders, the revenue impact of a 3x throughput increase dwarfs the machine cost.

For a typical $800,000–$1.2M custom assembly system, we see full payback in **14–24 months** when running two shifts. Three-shift operations often pay back in under a year.

## Common Challenges and How We Solve Them

**"Our product changes every 18 months."** We design for the product roadmap, not just today's part. Quick-change nests, recipe-driven servo parameters, and modular station design let you accommodate the next generation without rebuilding the machine.

**"We can't afford downtime during installation."** We build, debug, and run-off every machine at our facility using your actual production parts before it ships. On-site installation and commissioning typically takes 1–3 weeks, and we can phase the transition to keep your manual line running in parallel.

**"Our parts are difficult to feed."** We prototype feeding solutions early in the project using your actual parts—not just CAD models. If a bowl feeder can't handle it, we'll prove out a flex feeder or vision-guided approach before committing to the design.

**"We need to integrate with our existing MES."** We support all major communication protocols: OPC UA, MQTT, Ethernet/IP, PROFINET, and direct SQL or REST API connections. We've integrated with SAP, Plex, Ignition, and dozens of custom MES platforms.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What cycle times can a custom assembly system achieve?

It depends on the number of operations and product complexity. Rotary dial systems typically achieve 1.5–6 seconds per part. Linear transfer systems range from 5–30 seconds. We've built dial machines running under 2 seconds per cycle for simple two-component assemblies, and linear systems at 25 seconds for complex 20+ component medical devices.

### How long does it take from concept to production-ready machine?

A typical custom assembly system takes 6–9 months from signed purchase order to site acceptance test. Simple single-station cells can be faster (3–4 months), while complex multi-station lines with validation requirements may take 10–14 months. We provide a detailed timeline during the proposal phase.

### Can the machine handle multiple product variants?

Yes—and this is something we plan for from the beginning. Depending on the variants, we use recipe-driven servo parameters, quick-change fixture nests (swap time under 5 minutes), or fully flexible vision-guided robotic systems that handle variants without any changeover.

### What OEE should I expect?

We target 85% OEE during the run-off acceptance at our facility, and our installed base typically reaches 90–95% OEE within 6 months of production start. The biggest factors affecting OEE are part feeding reliability and incoming component quality—both things we address during the design phase.

### Do you provide training and ongoing support?

Absolutely. Every machine ships with comprehensive operator and maintenance training at our facility and at your site. We provide 24/7 phone support, remote diagnostics via secure VPN connection, and on-site [maintenance and support](/services/maintenance-support/) contracts. We also stock critical spare parts for fast turnaround on [replacement components](/services/spare-parts/).

### What controls platforms do you use?

We standardize on Allen-Bradley ControlLogix and CompactLogix PLCs for most applications, with Rockwell PanelView HMIs or Ignition-based SCADA for complex systems. Robot integrations include FANUC, ABB, KUKA, and Yaskawa depending on the application requirements. We also integrate Beckhoff TwinCAT and Siemens platforms when the customer's facility standard requires it.

### How do you handle validation for regulated industries?

For medical device and pharmaceutical customers, we provide full IQ/OQ/PQ documentation packages, GAMP 5 software documentation, 21 CFR Part 11-compliant data systems, and FAT/SAT protocols. Our project managers have led dozens of validated automation projects and understand what your quality team needs to see.
