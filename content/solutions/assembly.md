AMD Machines builds custom assembly machines that bring together multiple components into finished products with speed, precision, and reliability.

## Machine Configurations

**Rotary Dial Machines** - Multiple stations around a central indexing dial enable high-speed assembly with parallel processing. Ideal for products requiring many operations.

**Linear Transfer Systems** - Pallets move through sequential stations for larger products or longer cycle time operations. Easy to expand with additional stations.

**Flexible Assembly Cells** - Robot-based systems that can handle product variations and changeovers. Best for moderate volumes with multiple product types.

## Assembly Operations

Our machines perform a wide range of assembly operations:

- Component insertion and placement
- Press-fit and interference fit joining
- Screwdriving and fastening
- Adhesive and sealant dispensing
- Welding and staking
- Crimping and swaging
- Labeling and marking

## Part Feeding

Reliable part feeding is critical to assembly automation success. We design and integrate appropriate feeding systems for your components:

- Vibratory bowl feeders
- Centrifugal feeders
- Flex feeders with vision
- Magazine and tray systems
- Escapement mechanisms

## Error Proofing

Our assembly machines incorporate multiple levels of error proofing to prevent defects:

- Presence sensors verify components
- Force monitoring confirms proper assembly
- Vision systems inspect critical features
- Poka-yoke fixtures prevent incorrect loading
- Lockout systems stop production when errors occur

Every error is logged for quality records and continuous improvement analysis.
