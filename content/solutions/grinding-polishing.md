Automated grinding and polishing systems deliver consistent surface finishes that manual operations cannot match. AMD Automation designs finishing cells that combine [robotic flexibility](/solutions/robotic-cells/) with process expertise for reliable surface quality.

## Surface Finishing Technologies

### Robotic Grinding

Force-controlled grinding for precision:

- Constant contact force on contoured surfaces
- Adaptive compliance for part variation
- Automatic tool change for multi-stage processes
- Suitable for low to medium volumes

### Automated Polishing

Multi-stage systems for fine finishes:

- Progressive grit sequences
- Compound application control
- Buffing wheel and mop stations
- Mirror and satin finish capability

### Belt Grinding

High material removal for production:

- Wide belt machines for flat surfaces
- Contact wheel grinding for contours
- Slack belt for conforming
- Automated belt change systems

### Vibratory Finishing

Batch processing for high volumes:

- Deburring and edge radiusing
- Surface smoothing
- Burnishing for brightness
- Continuous flow systems

## Force Control Technology

Critical for quality finishing:

- **Active force control** - Robot adjusts position to maintain force
- **Passive compliance** - Mechanical floating for simple applications
- **Hybrid systems** - Combine active and passive for best results

## System Integration

Finishing cells integrate with production:

- **[Machine Vision](/solutions/machine-vision/)** - Surface inspection and defect detection
- **[Deburring](/solutions/deburring/)** - Combined deburring and finishing
- **[Assembly](/solutions/assembly/)** - Finish before final assembly

## Quality Assurance

Verify surface quality with:

- **Surface profilometry** - Measure Ra, Rz parameters
- **Visual inspection** - Detect scratches and defects
- **Gloss measurement** - Quantify finish appearance

## Industry Applications

- **[Automotive](/industries/automotive/)** - Trim, wheels, and appearance parts
- **[Aerospace](/industries/aerospace/)** - Turbine blades and structural components
- **[Medical](/industries/medical/)** - Implants and surgical instruments
- **[Consumer](/industries/consumer/)** - Appliances and hardware
