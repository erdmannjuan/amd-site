Here's a truth that most plant managers learn the hard way: your production equipment is only as fast as the material handling between it. I've walked into facilities running $2 million machining centers that were starved for parts because a forklift driver was on break. I've seen assembly lines capable of 45-second cycle times stuck at 90 seconds because an operator couldn't stage parts fast enough. And I've watched entire packaging lines shut down because someone stacked a pallet crooked and jammed the stretch wrapper.

Material handling is the circulatory system of your factory. When it works, nobody notices. When it doesn't, everything stops.

At AMD Machines, we've spent over 30 years designing material handling systems that connect every operation in your plant—from raw material receiving to finished goods shipping. We've built hundreds of systems across [automotive](/industries/automotive/), [consumer products](/industries/consumer/), [food and beverage](/industries/food-beverage/), and [heavy equipment](/industries/heavy-equipment/) manufacturing. We've learned what works, what breaks, and what separates a material handling system that transforms your throughput from one that just moves your bottleneck somewhere else.

## Why Material Handling Is the First Thing We Look At

When a customer calls us about automating an [assembly line](/solutions/assembly/) or a [robotic cell](/solutions/robotic-cells/), the first thing our engineers do on a site visit isn't look at the process—it's trace the material flow. How do parts get from the dock to the first operation? How do they move between stations? Where do they accumulate? Where do operators walk the farthest? Where are the forklifts creating traffic jams?

Nine times out of ten, the biggest productivity gains aren't in the process itself—they're in the handling between processes. Here's what the numbers typically look like:

- **Manual part transfer between stations:** 12–25 seconds per move, with 10–20% variability between operators
- **Automated transfer (conveyor or robot):** 2–6 seconds per move, with ±0.5-second repeatability
- **Manual palletizing:** 4–6 cases per minute with one operator, dropping to 2–3 cases per minute after four hours of fatigue
- **Robotic palletizing:** 15–30 cases per minute, 24/7, no fatigue, no back injuries
- **Manual kitting accuracy:** 97–99% (sounds good until you calculate 300–1,000 defective kits per 100,000)
- **Automated kitting with barcode verification:** 99.97%+ accuracy

The labor math is straightforward. A typical material handling automation project eliminates 3–8 manual handling positions per shift. At fully loaded labor costs of $55,000–$75,000 per position per year, a system handling two shifts saves $330,000–$1.2 million annually. Most of our material handling systems pay for themselves in 12–18 months.

## Conveyor Systems: The Backbone of Automated Handling

Conveyors are the oldest form of manufacturing automation, and they're still the most cost-effective way to move high volumes of parts or products along a predictable path. But modern conveyor systems are nothing like the simple belt-and-roller setups from 30 years ago. Today's systems integrate servo-driven positioning, RFID tracking, accumulation logic, and smart divert stations that make routing decisions in real time.

We design and build four primary conveyor types, and most systems combine two or more:

### Belt Conveyors

The workhorse of material handling. We use belt conveyors for continuous transport of parts ranging from small electronics components to 50-lb castings. Modern belt systems from Dorner, mk North America, and FlexLink give us modular construction with clean, low-maintenance designs. Key specs we design around:

- **Speed range:** 10–200 feet per minute (adjustable via VFD or servo)
- **Load capacity:** Up to 150 lbs per linear foot for standard designs
- **Accumulation:** Zero-pressure accumulation zones prevent part damage during backups
- **Cleanliness:** FDA-compliant belt materials for [food and beverage](/industries/food-beverage/) and [pharmaceutical](/industries/pharmaceutical/) applications

### Pallet Transfer Systems

When you need precise positioning for [assembly](/solutions/assembly/) or machining operations, pallet transfer conveyors are the answer. Parts ride on machined pallets (typically aluminum or delrin) that locate at each station with ±0.05 mm repeatability. We use systems from Bosch Rexroth and FlexLink for high-precision applications, with Rockwell Automation servo drives controlling indexing motion.

Pallet transfer is the backbone of most automated assembly lines we build. A typical system runs 20–60 pallets in a loop, with lift-and-locate stations at each process point. Cycle times of 3–8 seconds per index are standard.

### Roller Conveyors

Powered and gravity roller conveyors handle heavier loads—pallets, totes, cases—at lower speeds. We use them extensively in end-of-line packaging, warehouse staging, and inter-process buffering. Powered rollers from Hytrol and Interroll give us zone-based accumulation control, where each zone independently starts and stops to manage product flow without contact pressure.

### Overhead Conveyors

For operations where floor space is at a premium—and that's most factories—overhead conveyors move parts above the production floor. We design power-and-free systems that allow parts to accumulate, divert, and index independently. They're particularly effective for paint lines, curing ovens, and any process where parts need to travel vertically between floor levels.

## Pick-and-Place Systems: Speed and Precision

Pick-and-place automation is the bridge between bulk material handling and process stations. It's how you get individual parts from a conveyor, feeder, or tray into precise positions for assembly, inspection, packaging, or testing.

We integrate four primary pick-and-place technologies, each optimized for different speed, reach, and payload combinations:

### SCARA Robots

For high-speed pick-and-place in a horizontal plane, SCARA robots from FANUC (SR series), Epson (T-series), and Omron (i4 series) are our go-to. A FANUC SR-3iA picks 120+ parts per minute with ±0.01 mm repeatability—fast enough for electronics assembly, small-part packaging, and high-speed [test system](/solutions/test-systems/) loading. Typical payloads: 1–20 kg.

### Six-Axis Articulated Robots

When parts need complex orientation changes—flipping, rotating, or approaching from unusual angles—six-axis robots from FANUC (LR Mate, M-10, M-20 series), ABB (IRB 1200, IRB 2600), or Yaskawa (GP series) handle it. These robots give us the flexibility to pick from one orientation and place in another, navigate around obstacles, and service multiple stations from a single mount point. We use them heavily in [machine tending](/solutions/machine-tending/) handoff applications.

### Cartesian Gantry Systems

For long-reach, high-payload applications—moving engine blocks between machining stations, transferring large panels, or servicing multiple machines across 10+ meters—Cartesian gantry systems offer the best combination of reach, payload, and cost. We design custom gantries using linear actuators from Bosch Rexroth, Parker Hannifin, and Festo, with payloads up to 500 kg and strokes up to 20 meters.

### Delta Robots

When you need the absolute fastest pick-and-place—think small, light parts at 200+ picks per minute—delta robots from FANUC (M-1iA, M-3iA) and ABB (IRB 360 FlexPicker) are purpose-built for the job. We pair them with Cognex or Keyence vision systems tracking parts on moving conveyors, enabling the robot to pick on-the-fly without stopping the belt. This is standard in food packaging, pharmaceutical blister pack loading, and small electronics handling.

## AGVs and AMRs: Flexible Material Transport

The biggest shift in material handling over the past five years has been the rise of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) and their older cousins, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). These platforms replace forklifts and manual carts for point-to-point transport throughout your facility.

We integrate AMR platforms from OTTO Motors (now Rockwell), MiR (Mobile Industrial Robots), and Locus Robotics into our material handling systems. Here's where they make sense and where they don't:

**Where AMRs win:**
- Flexible routing between 5+ pickup/dropoff points that change with production mix
- Long-distance transport (200+ feet) where conveyors would be expensive and inflexible
- Facilities undergoing frequent layout changes
- Deliveries to [robotic cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/) that don't need continuous material flow

**Where conveyors still win:**
- High-volume, fixed-path transport (sustained flow of 20+ parts per minute)
- Short distances between adjacent workstations
- Applications requiring precise timing synchronization with process equipment
- Environments with heavy forklift traffic or narrow aisles

Most modern systems we design combine both: conveyors within work cells and between closely spaced stations, with AMRs handling longer transport routes and inter-cell material delivery.

## Part Orientation and Feeding: The Unsung Hero

Here's a war story. A customer called us because their existing automation line was running at half its designed rate. The assembly stations, the [screw driving](/solutions/screwdriving/) cells, the [test equipment](/solutions/test-systems/)—all capable of 15-second cycle times. But the line was bottlenecked at 30 seconds because the vibratory bowl feeder couldn't orient and singulate parts fast enough, and it jammed every 20 minutes.

Part feeding and orientation is the most underestimated element of material handling automation. It doesn't matter how fast your downstream equipment runs if you can't get parts to it in the right orientation, at the right rate, without jamming.

We design feeding systems around three core technologies:

**Vibratory Bowl Feeders** — The classic approach. A bowl with machined tracks uses vibration to orient parts as they travel along the track. Rates of 30–200 parts per minute depending on part geometry. We use feeders from RNA Automation and Performance Feeders, with custom-machined tooling for each part. Best for: dedicated lines running one part number at high volume.

**Flex Feeders (Vision-Guided)** — A flat vibrating surface presents randomly scattered parts to an overhead camera (typically Cognex In-Sight or Keyence CV-X series). The vision system identifies part position and orientation, and a robot picks only correctly oriented parts. Rates of 20–60 parts per minute. Best for: mixed-model lines or parts that are difficult to orient mechanically.

**Centrifugal Feeders** — A spinning disc with peripheral tooling orients parts at extremely high speeds—200–600 parts per minute for small components. We use these for fastener feeding, cap feeding, and any small-part application where rate matters more than flexibility.

## Real-World Application: Automotive Transmission Component Line

An automotive Tier 1 supplier came to us with a problem: their transmission valve body line was producing 800 units per shift with 14 operators handling material between stations. They needed to hit 1,200 units per shift to win a new contract, and they couldn't hire more people—the labor market wouldn't allow it.

We designed a complete material handling system that reduced the operator count from 14 to 4 while increasing output to 1,350 units per shift:

- **Pallet transfer conveyor** with 40 precision pallets indexing between 12 assembly and [test stations](/solutions/test-systems/)
- **Two FANUC M-20iD/25 robots** performing inter-station transfer where parts needed orientation changes
- **Three flex feeder stations** with Cognex vision for feeding small components (valves, springs, check balls)
- **End-of-line FANUC M-710iC/50 palletizing robot** building finished goods pallets
- **Dorner belt conveyors** for scrap removal and empty container return

The line runs at a 22-second takt time with 96.5% uptime. ROI was achieved in 14 months.

## Real-World Application: Consumer Products Packaging Line

A consumer goods manufacturer was manually packaging 12 SKUs of household products into retail-ready cases. Manual rates topped out at 18 cases per minute with 6 operators per line. They needed 30 cases per minute to support a new retail contract.

Our system combined:

- **High-speed belt conveyor system** with servo-driven lane diverters sorting products to the correct packaging stations
- **Two ABB IRB 360 FlexPicker delta robots** with Cognex vision performing primary pick-and-place at 180 picks per minute
- **FANUC M-410iC/110 palletizing robot** building mixed-SKU pallets with layer pads
- **MiR 500 AMR fleet** (3 units) transporting finished pallets to the warehouse

Result: 35 cases per minute sustained, operator count reduced from 6 to 2, and the system handles all 12 SKUs with recipe-driven changeover in under 3 minutes.

## Integration and Controls: Making It All Work Together

Material handling systems fail for one reason more than any other: poor integration. The conveyors work, the robots work, the feeders work—but they don't talk to each other correctly, and the result is jams, starved stations, and operators babysitting automated equipment.

Every material handling system we build runs on a unified controls architecture, typically Rockwell Automation (Allen-Bradley ControlLogix or CompactLogix) or Siemens (S7-1500) PLCs. The material handling controls integrate with:

- **Upstream and downstream process equipment** via EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, or EtherCAT
- **Robot controllers** (FANUC, ABB, Yaskawa, KUKA) via direct Ethernet communication
- **Vision systems** (Cognex, Keyence) for part tracking and quality verification
- **MES/ERP systems** via OPC UA for production tracking and scheduling
- **RFID and barcode systems** for part and pallet tracking throughout the material flow

We also design smart accumulation logic that prevents the most common material handling failures: conveyor jams from back-pressure, robot starvation from upstream delays, and buffer overflow from downstream blockages. Sensors at critical points—photoelectric, proximity, and load cells—feed real-time data to the PLC, which dynamically adjusts conveyor speeds, robot priorities, and divert routing.

## Common Material Handling Challenges (and How We Solve Them)

**Challenge: Parts damage during transport.** Rough handling scratches cosmetic surfaces, dents soft metals, or breaks fragile components. **Solution:** We design part-specific carriers, nests, and puck fixtures that cradle parts during transport. For surface-sensitive parts, we use soft-belt conveyors and pneumatic grippers with force-limited pick-and-place.

**Challenge: Changeover between product variants.** Manual changeover of conveyors, feeders, and fixtures eats production time. **Solution:** We design systems with servo-driven tool-less adjustment, recipe-driven changeover, and quick-change fixtures. Target: under 5 minutes for most changeovers, under 30 seconds for recipe-only changes.

**Challenge: System jams and stoppages.** Parts misalign, sensors misread, conveyors back up. **Solution:** We build jam detection and auto-recovery logic into every system. Photoelectric sensor arrays detect jams within 2 seconds, and the system executes automatic clearing sequences before an operator even notices.

**Challenge: Floor space constraints.** Most facilities can't spare a football field for conveyors. **Solution:** We design vertical material flow using elevators, overhead conveyors, and multi-level accumulation. We've squeezed complete material handling systems into footprints 40% smaller than the customer expected.

## The Business Case for Material Handling Automation

The ROI on material handling automation is typically the fastest payback of any automation investment because it directly eliminates the most labor-intensive, lowest-value work in your facility. Here's what we consistently see across projects:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Handling labor per line | 6–14 operators | 1–4 operators |
| Parts damaged in transit | 1.5–3% | Under 0.1% |
| Inter-station transfer time | 12–25 seconds | 2–6 seconds |
| Throughput increase | Baseline | 30–75% improvement |
| Ergonomic injury incidents | 4–8 per year | Near zero |
| Typical payback period | — | 10–18 months |

Beyond direct labor savings, consider the secondary benefits: lower workers' compensation costs (material handling injuries account for over 30% of manufacturing recordable incidents according to OSHA data), reduced product damage and scrap, improved traceability for quality and regulatory compliance, and the ability to redeploy skilled workers from moving parts to higher-value tasks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the typical payback period for a material handling automation project?

Most of our material handling systems pay back in 10–18 months, driven primarily by labor reduction. Smaller projects (single conveyor line or pick-and-place station) can pay back in under 8 months. Larger facility-wide systems with AGVs and complex integration typically take 14–24 months but deliver significantly higher total savings.

### Can you integrate with our existing equipment, or does everything need to be new?

We integrate with existing equipment in most projects—that's the reality of brownfield manufacturing. We've tied new conveyor systems into 20-year-old PLCs, interfaced modern robots with legacy process equipment, and connected AMRs to existing warehouse management systems. The key is proper controls engineering and protocol bridging.

### How do we handle changeover between different products or SKUs?

We design for your changeover requirements from day one. Recipe-driven systems handle SKU changes in seconds through the HMI. Physical changeovers (different part nests, feeder tooling) use quick-change mechanisms that operators swap in 2–5 minutes. For high-mix environments, we design universal fixtures that handle multiple part families without any changeover.

### What's the maintenance burden on a material handling system?

Modern conveyor and robotic material handling systems are remarkably low-maintenance. Belt conveyors need belt tension checks and replacement every 12–24 months. Robots need grease changes every 3–5 years (FANUC's schedule). Sensors and controls are solid-state with no wear items. We provide preventive maintenance schedules with every system and offer ongoing [maintenance and support services](/services/maintenance-support/).

### Do we need to rip out our floor to install conveyors?

Rarely. Most conveyor systems are floor-mounted on adjustable leveling feet or overhead-mounted from existing steel. Pallet transfer systems may need embedded locating pins at stations, but that's a minor concrete job. AGVs and AMRs need no floor modification at all—just clear paths and WiFi coverage.

### How do you handle mixed-model production where different products need different handling?

This is one of the most common requirements we see. We use a combination of approaches: RFID or barcode identification at the entry point tells the system what product is on each carrier; servo-driven conveyors and diverters route products to the correct stations; and vision-guided robots adapt their pick patterns based on product ID. The PLC manages it all through recipe-based control.

### What safety standards apply to material handling automation?

All our systems comply with ANSI/RIA 15.06 (industrial robot safety), ANSI B20.1 (conveyor safety), and applicable OSHA regulations. We perform risk assessments per ISO 12100 and design guarding, E-stops, and safety-rated controls per ISO 13849 Performance Level requirements. Our [consulting services](/services/consulting/) can help evaluate your specific safety requirements before a project begins.
