Here's a truth most automation salespeople won't tell you: roughly 40% of the manufacturing challenges we see at AMD Machines don't have an off-the-shelf solution. The part's too odd, the process is proprietary, the floor space is too tight, or the tolerances are too demanding for anything in a catalog. That's where custom automation equipment comes in — and it's where we've spent the last 30 years building our reputation, delivering over 2,500 special purpose machines across every industry you can name.

Custom automation isn't just "we'll modify a standard machine." It's ground-up engineering: we design the mechanism, the tooling, the controls architecture, and the safety systems around your exact product and process. When it's done right, you end up with equipment that runs faster, handles more variants, and costs less to maintain than anything you could cobble together from standard components.

## Why Custom Automation Equipment? When Standard Won't Cut It

Standard automation products — [robotic cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/), off-the-shelf conveyors, catalog dispensing systems — cover maybe 60% of manufacturing applications. They're proven, well-supported, and cost-effective. We build plenty of those systems ourselves.

But manufacturing throws curveballs constantly:

- **Unusual part geometries**: We've built machines to handle everything from 18-inch turbine blades to 2mm micro-optics. Try finding a standard fixture for a part that's shaped like a hockey stick with a 0.05mm flatness requirement.
- **Proprietary processes**: If your competitive advantage lives in *how* you make something, you're not going to find that process in a catalog. We've engineered custom joining processes, proprietary coating systems, and specialized forming operations that exist nowhere else.
- **Space constraints**: One automotive Tier 1 supplier needed a 4-station assembly cell in a 10×12-foot footprint. Standard robotic cells need twice that space. We designed a compact rotary dial system with overhead FANUC LR Mate 200iD robots that delivered 22-second cycle times in half the floor space.
- **Integration with legacy equipment**: Your 1990s-era hydraulic press still works fine, but it needs to talk to a modern SCADA system and feed data to your MES. We've bridged that gap hundreds of times.
- **Mid-volume production**: You're making 50,000 parts a year — too many for manual assembly, not enough to justify a $2M high-speed line. Custom automation fills that sweet spot with right-sized solutions that often pay back in 12–18 months.

For these situations, a purpose-built machine outperforms anything you could retrofit or adapt. We've seen manufacturers waste 6–12 months trying to make standard equipment work before calling us to build what they actually needed.

## How Custom Automation Equipment Gets Built: Our Proven Process

After 2,500+ machines, we've refined a development process that eliminates surprises and delivers equipment that works on Day One. Here's how it actually goes:

### Phase 1: Discovery and Requirements Engineering

We don't start with a sales pitch — we start with questions. Our engineers visit your facility, watch your operators, measure your parts, and document every requirement in a formal User Requirements Specification (URS). This typically covers:

- Part tolerances and material properties
- Cycle time targets (we get specific — "under 15 seconds" isn't the same as "under 12 seconds")
- Throughput requirements by shift and by variant
- Quality specifications and inspection criteria
- Changeover requirements between product variants
- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, cleanliness)
- Utility requirements (compressed air, electrical, cooling water)

This phase usually takes 1–2 weeks. We don't rush it, because getting the requirements wrong here means building the wrong machine.

### Phase 2: Concept Development and Trade-Off Analysis

We develop 2–3 concept approaches and present them with honest trade-off analysis. For a recent [servo press](/solutions/servo-pressing/) integration project, we evaluated three architectures:

- **Option A**: Linear transfer with servo press stations — highest throughput, largest footprint
- **Option B**: Rotary dial with integrated pressing — compact, moderate throughput
- **Option C**: Flexible robotic cell with press station — lowest throughput, highest flexibility

Each concept gets a rough cycle time estimate, floor space requirement, cost range, and risk assessment. You pick the direction with full visibility into the trade-offs.

### Phase 3: Detailed Engineering Design

This is where the real engineering happens. Our team works in SolidWorks and handles:

- **Mechanical design**: Frame structures, tooling, fixturing, motion systems. We design to ANSI/RIA standards and use FEA analysis on critical structural components.
- **Electrical controls**: Panel layouts, wiring schematics, I/O mapping. We standardize on Allen-Bradley ControlLogix and CompactLogix platforms for most projects, with Siemens S7-1500 available for European-spec requirements.
- **Servo motion**: Multi-axis coordinated motion using Rockwell Kinetix or Yaskawa Sigma-7 servo drives, depending on the application. We've implemented systems with up to 24 coordinated axes.
- **HMI development**: Operator interfaces on Rockwell PanelView Plus or Siemens Comfort Panels, designed with input from your operators — not just our engineers.
- **Safety systems**: Full risk assessments per ISO 13849 / ANSI/RIA 15.06, with safety PLCs (Allen-Bradley GuardLogix or Pilz PNOZ) and properly rated safety devices.

We conduct formal design reviews at 30%, 60%, and 90% completion. You see everything before we cut metal.

### Phase 4: Build, Integration, and Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)

Our 50,000+ sq ft facility handles fabrication, machining, assembly, and testing under one roof. This matters — we're not coordinating between five subcontractors. During build:

- All welded frames are stress-relieved and precision-machined
- Electrical panels are built to UL 508A standards
- Pneumatic systems follow ISO 4414 guidelines
- Every sensor, actuator, and safety device gets individually verified

The FAT is comprehensive. We run your actual parts (or validated samples) through production scenarios, test every failure mode we can simulate, and validate cycle times with statistical data — not just "it ran once."

### Phase 5: Installation, Commissioning, and Site Acceptance Testing (SAT)

We handle rigging, positioning, utility connections, and commissioning at your facility. The SAT validates performance in your actual production environment, including integration with your existing lines, MES connectivity, and operator workflow validation.

### Phase 6: Training, Documentation, and Lifecycle Support

Every machine ships with full documentation: mechanical drawings, electrical schematics, PLC program documentation, spare parts lists, and maintenance procedures. We train your operators and maintenance staff on-site, and our [service team](/services/maintenance-support/) provides ongoing support — including remote diagnostics via secure VPN connections.

## Engineering Capabilities That Make Custom Automation Work

Building special purpose machines requires deep expertise across multiple engineering disciplines. Here's what we bring to every project:

### Mechanical and Motion Systems
- Precision linear motion: ball screws, linear motors, and cam-driven systems with positioning accuracy to ±0.01mm
- Rotary indexing: cam-driven dial tables (Colombo Filippetti, Destaco Camco) and direct-drive torque motors
- Custom tooling and fixturing designed for rapid changeover (target: under 5 minutes between variants)
- Pneumatic systems (SMC, Festo) and hydraulic systems for applications requiring forces up to 50 tons

### Controls and Software
- PLC programming: Allen-Bradley (ControlLogix, CompactLogix, GuardLogix), Siemens (S7-1500, S7-1200), Omron (NX/NJ series)
- Robot integration: FANUC, ABB, Yaskawa Motoman, KUKA, and Universal Robots
- [Machine vision](/solutions/machine-vision/): Cognex In-Sight and VisionPro, Keyence CV-X and XG-X series for inline inspection
- Servo motion: coordinated multi-axis motion with electronic camming, gearing, and registration
- Data connectivity: OPC-UA, MQTT, and REST API interfaces for MES/ERP integration

### Safety Engineering
- Risk assessments per ISO 12100 and ISO 13849
- Safety system design to Performance Level d or e as required
- Light curtains, safety scanners (SICK, Keyence), interlock switches, and safety-rated monitored stops
- Full compliance with OSHA, ANSI/RIA 15.06, and NFPA 79

## Real-World Custom Automation Applications

### Medical Device Assembly: Catheter Sub-Assembly System

A medical device manufacturer needed to automate assembly of a 7-component catheter sub-assembly with tolerances under ±0.025mm. The parts were too small and delicate for standard robotic handling, and the process required 100% inline inspection per FDA 21 CFR Part 820.

We built a custom 8-station rotary dial machine with precision vacuum grippers, ultrasonic welding (Branson 2000X), and Cognex In-Sight 9000 vision inspection at three stations. The system achieves 6.5-second cycle time per assembly, runs at Cpk > 1.67 on critical dimensions, and logs every measurement to a traceability database. It replaced a 4-person manual assembly operation and improved first-pass yield from 94% to 99.7%.

### Automotive: Transmission Component Assembly and Test

An automotive Tier 1 supplier needed a custom system to assemble and test a 12-component transmission valve body. The process included pressing, [screwdriving](/solutions/screwdriving/) (8 fasteners at precise torque values), leak testing at 5 bar, and electrical functional testing — all at 45-second takt time.

We delivered a linear transfer system with 6 automated stations, integrating FANUC M-10iD robots for part handling, Atlas Copco torque spindles for fastening, and a custom-built multi-circuit leak test station. The system handles 3 valve body variants with automated changeover via recipe selection. It produces 720 assemblies per shift with zero-defect escapes since installation.

### Consumer Electronics: Flexible Product Customization Cell

A consumer electronics company needed to laser-engrave, assemble, and package customized products in lot sizes as small as one unit. Standard automation couldn't handle the variability — every unit could have different engraving, different component combinations, and different packaging configurations.

We engineered a flexible cell with a FANUC CRX-10iA collaborative robot, a KEYENCE MD-X fiber laser marker, and a custom software layer that pulls order configurations from the customer's ERP system in real time. The cell processes up to 200 unique configurations per shift with zero changeover time between variants. Order-to-ship time dropped from 5 days to same-day fulfillment.

## ROI and Business Case for Custom Automation Equipment

Custom automation isn't cheap — typical projects range from $150K for a focused single-station machine to $1.5M+ for a complete multi-station assembly line. But the ROI numbers consistently justify the investment:

- **Labor reduction**: Most custom machines replace 2–6 operators per shift. At fully burdened labor costs of $55K–$75K per operator per year, a 3-person reduction on two shifts saves $330K–$450K annually.
- **Quality improvement**: Automated processes typically improve first-pass yield by 3–8 percentage points. On a product with a $15 scrap cost, improving yield from 95% to 99% on 500,000 annual units saves $300K per year.
- **Throughput gains**: Custom machines often run 30–50% faster than adapted standard equipment because every motion is optimized for your specific parts.
- **Reduced floor space**: Purpose-built machines are typically 25–40% more compact than equivalent manual workstations, freeing valuable manufacturing floor space.
- **Typical payback period**: 12–24 months for most custom automation projects, with some high-volume applications paying back in under 9 months.

We provide detailed ROI models during the concept phase so you can make investment decisions with real numbers — not guesses.

## Common Challenges in Custom Automation (and How We Handle Them)

**"Scope creep during development."** Our formal requirements process and stage-gate reviews keep projects on track. Changes after design freeze are documented, impact-assessed, and approved before implementation.

**"The machine worked at FAT but struggles in production."** We insist on running real production parts during FAT and design for your actual environmental conditions — not clean-room lab conditions. Our SAT process validates performance in your plant.

**"We can't get spare parts."** We standardize on widely available commercial components (Allen-Bradley, FANUC, SMC, Festo) wherever possible. Custom-machined parts are fully documented with drawings so any competent machine shop can reproduce them.

**"Our maintenance team can't troubleshoot it."** Every machine includes comprehensive troubleshooting guides, and our HMI designs include diagnostic screens that guide technicians through fault recovery. We also provide on-site maintenance training and remote support.

**"The integrator disappeared after installation."** We've been in business for over 30 years and we're not going anywhere. Our [ongoing support services](/services/maintenance-support/) include preventive maintenance programs, remote diagnostics, and guaranteed spare parts availability.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Custom Automation

### How long does a custom automation project take from concept to installation?
Most projects take 6–9 months from contract signing to installation. Simple single-station machines can be done in 4–5 months; complex multi-station lines with extensive testing requirements may take 12–14 months. The biggest variable is usually the design approval phase — faster feedback from your team means faster delivery.

### What information do we need to provide to get started?
At minimum, we need sample parts (or detailed drawings), target cycle times, annual volume requirements, and quality specifications. The more detail you can provide about your current process, reject rates, and pain points, the better our initial concept will be.

### Can custom machines handle multiple product variants?
Absolutely — in fact, flexibility is one of the primary reasons manufacturers choose custom over standard. We routinely design machines that handle 5–20+ variants with quick-change tooling, recipe-based changeover, and servo-driven adjustments. Changeover targets of under 5 minutes are standard; many of our systems change over automatically with no operator intervention.

### How do you handle machine acceptance and performance guarantees?
Every project includes a formal FAT at our facility and SAT at yours, with agreed-upon acceptance criteria documented in the purchase order. We guarantee cycle time, throughput, uptime (typically 95%+ OEE), and quality metrics. If the machine doesn't meet spec, we fix it at our expense — period.

### What controls platforms do you work with?
We're platform-flexible but typically standardize on Allen-Bradley (ControlLogix, CompactLogix) for North American projects and Siemens (S7-1500) for projects with European specifications. We also work with Omron, Beckhoff, and B&R platforms based on customer requirements or plant standards.

### Do you provide ongoing support after installation?
Yes. Our [service and support](/services/maintenance-support/) programs include remote diagnostics, preventive maintenance scheduling, spare parts management, and emergency on-site service. Most issues are resolved remotely within hours. For critical production equipment, we offer service level agreements with guaranteed response times.

### Can you integrate custom equipment with our existing MES/ERP systems?
We design for connectivity from the start. Our standard controls architecture includes OPC-UA server capability, and we've integrated with SAP, Oracle, Plex, Ignition, and dozens of other MES/ERP platforms. Data logging, traceability, and real-time production monitoring are standard features on every machine we build.
