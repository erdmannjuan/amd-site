Machine vision systems use cameras and image processing to perform inspection, guidance, and measurement tasks that traditionally required human vision. AMD Automation designs custom vision solutions that integrate seamlessly with your [robotic cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/) and [assembly systems](/solutions/assembly/).

## Vision System Capabilities

### 2D Vision Inspection

Standard 2D vision excels at:

- Surface defect detection (scratches, dents, contamination)
- Presence/absence verification
- Label and print quality inspection
- Dimensional measurement in a single plane
- Pattern matching for part identification

### 3D Vision Systems

When geometry matters, 3D vision provides:

- Height measurement and surface profiling
- Volume calculation for fill-level inspection
- Complex geometry verification
- Bin picking with random part orientation
- Weld bead inspection

### AI and Deep Learning

Modern AI-powered vision handles:

- Complex defect classification
- Anomaly detection without explicit programming
- Variable appearance inspection (wood grain, textiles)
- Continuous learning from production data

## Integration with Automation

Machine vision integrates with all AMD automation solutions:

- **[Robotic Cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/)** - Vision-guided picking and placement
- **[Assembly Systems](/solutions/assembly/)** - Verification at each assembly step
- **[Test Systems](/solutions/test-systems/)** - Visual inspection as part of functional testing
- **[Material Handling](/solutions/material-handling/)** - Part identification and routing

## Industries Served

Our vision systems operate across [automotive](/industries/automotive/), [medical device](/industries/medical/), [electronics](/industries/electronics/), and [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/) manufacturing where quality requirements demand automated inspection.
