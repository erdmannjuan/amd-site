Automated dispensing systems apply adhesives, sealants, lubricants, and coatings with precision control. AMD Machines designs dispensing stations that integrate with your [assembly operations](/solutions/assembly/) for consistent, efficient material application.

## Dispensing Technologies

### Volumetric Dispensing

Precise volume control for critical applications:

- Progressive cavity pumps for consistent flow
- Piston dispensers for accurate shot sizes
- Gear pumps for continuous bead application
- Peristaltic pumps for sensitive materials

### Time-Pressure Dispensing

Economical option for less critical applications:

- Adjustable pressure and time control
- Suitable for lower viscosity materials
- Simple maintenance and operation
- Lower equipment cost

### Two-Component Systems

For reactive adhesives and potting compounds:

- Accurate ratio control
- Static and dynamic mixing
- Purge and flush systems
- Material temperature control

## Motion Platforms

Dispensing systems use various motion configurations:

- **[Robotic](/solutions/robotic-cells/)** - 6-axis flexibility for complex geometries
- **Gantry** - High speed for planar applications
- **Fixed** - Part moves under stationary dispenser
- **Collaborative** - Manual load with automated dispense

## Quality Assurance

Ensure dispensing quality with:

- **[Machine Vision](/solutions/machine-vision/)** - Verify bead presence and quality
- **Weight verification** - Confirm dispensed quantity
- **Pattern inspection** - Check coverage and continuity

## Industry Applications

- **[Automotive](/industries/automotive/)** - Body sealing, glass bonding, component assembly
- **[Electronics](/industries/electronics/)** - Conformal coating, underfill, potting
- **[Aerospace](/industries/aerospace/)** - Structural bonding, fuel tank sealing
- **[Medical](/industries/medical/)** - Device assembly, encapsulation
