Here's something that took me years on the factory floor to truly appreciate: dispensing is one of the most deceptively difficult processes in manufacturing automation. It looks straightforward—squirt adhesive onto a part, move to the next station. But when you're running 800 parts per hour and your customer's quality spec says the bead can't vary by more than ±0.15 mm in width or ±2% in volume, suddenly "squirting adhesive" becomes an exercise in fluid dynamics, thermal management, motion control, and real-time quality inspection all happening simultaneously.

At AMD Machines, we've integrated hundreds of dispensing systems across [automotive](/industries/automotive/), [electronics](/industries/electronics/), [medical device](/industries/medical/), and [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/) manufacturing. We've learned the hard way which dispensing technologies work for which materials, which motion platforms hit the cycle times you need, and—most importantly—how to verify bead quality at production speed so defects never reach your customer.

## Why Automated Dispensing Matters More Than Ever

Manual dispensing worked fine when tolerances were loose and volumes were low. But three trends have pushed manufacturers toward automation, and they're not slowing down.

First, **structural adhesives are replacing mechanical fasteners** across industries. Modern two-component epoxies and polyurethanes deliver bond strengths exceeding 30 MPa—stronger than the substrates in many applications. Automotive OEMs are bonding structural panels, electronics manufacturers are replacing screws with adhesive, and medical device companies are using UV-cure adhesives to eliminate assembly steps. But structural bonds demand precise material placement. A bead that's 20% light creates a weak joint. A bead that's 20% heavy wastes expensive adhesive and creates squeeze-out that requires cleaning.

Second, **form-in-place gasketing has replaced die-cut gaskets** on thousands of products. Instead of cutting, inventorying, and manually placing a molded gasket, you dispense a bead of RTV silicone or polyurethane directly onto the sealing surface. It's faster, cheaper, and eliminates gasket compression set as a failure mode. But it requires a dispensing system that holds bead width, height, and position within tight tolerances—typically ±0.2 mm on position and ±10% on volume.

Third, **conformal coating and potting requirements are expanding** as electronics move into harsher environments. Automotive electronics, outdoor sensors, and industrial controls all need moisture protection, and the coverage requirements are getting more demanding every year.

The bottom line: if you're still dispensing by hand, you're leaving quality and money on the table. Across our installed base, customers switching from manual to automated dispensing typically see:

- **30–50% reduction** in material waste
- **85–95% reduction** in rework from dispense defects
- **3–5x throughput improvement** per operator
- **Full payback** in 12–18 months on two-shift operations

## Dispensing Technologies: Choosing the Right Pump

Choosing the right dispensing technology is the single most important decision in a dispensing automation project. The wrong pump for your material means inconsistent bead sizes, constant maintenance, and a system that never hits its quality targets. Here's how we think about it after integrating every major dispensing platform on the market.

### Progressive Cavity Pumps

Progressive cavity (PC) pumps are our go-to for medium-to-high viscosity materials—silicones, polyurethanes, and filled epoxies in the 50,000–500,000 cP range. The rotating helical rotor inside a stationary stator creates positive displacement, delivering consistent flow rates regardless of material viscosity changes.

We integrate Nordson EFD, Graco, and Viscotec progressive cavity systems extensively. On a recent [automotive](/industries/automotive/) gasketing line, we used a Viscotec ViscoTec eco-PEN450 to dispense RTV silicone at 150 mm/s with ±1.5% volume consistency—and the pump ran for over 14 months before needing a rotor/stator replacement.

**Best for:** FIPG (form-in-place gasket), structural adhesives, thermal interface materials, and any application where flow consistency over long runs is critical.

### Jetting Valves

Jetting technology changed the game for high-speed, small-volume dispensing. Instead of contact dispensing where the needle touches the substrate, jetting valves fire discrete droplets from a standoff height of 1–3 mm. That means no Z-axis motion to approach and retract from the part surface—just continuous XY motion at speeds up to 500 mm/s.

We've had excellent results with Nordson ASYMTEK DJ-9500 and Musashi ML-5000X III jet valves. On an [electronics](/industries/electronics/) conformal coating application, the DJ-9500 placed 0.5 nL dots at 200 Hz with ±3% volume consistency—coating a PCB in 1.8 seconds that took 12 seconds with a contact needle dispenser.

**Best for:** Conformal coating, underfill, small-dot adhesive bonding, and any application requiring high speed with small deposit volumes (nanoliter to low microliter range).

### Piston Dispensers

For precise shot-size control in the microliter-to-milliliter range, piston dispensers deliver the most accurate volumetric metering available. A servo-driven or pneumatic piston draws a calibrated volume of material and dispenses it in a single stroke.

We integrate Nordson EFD's Ultimus and 7V series, Techcon TS Series, and Scheugenpflug dispensers across many applications. Piston dispensing is the technology we reach for when dot size accuracy is non-negotiable—medical device adhesive bonding, lubricant deposition, and solder paste dispensing.

**Best for:** Precise dot dispensing, small-shot metering, lubricant application, and applications requiring ±1% or better volume accuracy.

### Two-Component (2K) Meter-Mix Systems

Reactive adhesives—two-part epoxies, polyurethanes, and silicones—require precision ratio control between the resin and hardener. Get the ratio wrong by even 5% and you'll have soft bonds, uncured material, or dramatically reduced pot life in the mixing element.

We integrate Graco PR70, Nordson EFD's 2K systems, and Scheugenpflug DosP and DosC platforms for two-component dispensing. These systems use gear or piston metering to maintain mix ratios within ±1% by volume, with continuous ratio monitoring and automatic fault detection.

On a structural bonding application for an [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/) customer, we integrated a Scheugenpflug DosP system dispensing a two-part epoxy at a 10:1 ratio with ±0.5% ratio accuracy. The system monitors both component pressures continuously and flags any deviation before defective material reaches the part.

**Best for:** Structural adhesives, potting compounds, two-part silicones, and any reactive material that requires in-line mixing.

### Time-Pressure Dispensing

The simplest and most economical dispensing method: pressurize a material reservoir and open a valve for a calibrated time. No moving parts in the fluid path means minimal maintenance.

We still use time-pressure dispensing for low-criticality applications—thread-locking fluid, lubricant dots on low-value parts, and prototyping. But be aware of its limitations: viscosity changes with temperature directly affect dispense volume, and the technique isn't suitable for applications requiring better than ±5% volume accuracy.

**Best for:** Low-cost applications, low-viscosity materials, thread lockers, and situations where ±5–10% volume variation is acceptable.

## Motion Platforms for Dispensing

The dispensing valve is only half the system. The motion platform determines speed, path accuracy, and application flexibility. We select the platform based on your part geometry, cycle time, and future product roadmap.

### 6-Axis Robotic Dispensing

For complex 3D part geometries—automotive housings, appliance enclosures, aerospace panels—nothing matches the flexibility of a 6-axis robot. We integrate FANUC LR Mate 200iD and M-10iD robots with dispensing valve brackets, giving you six degrees of freedom to follow contoured surfaces at consistent standoff distances.

FANUC's path accuracy at dispensing speeds (50–300 mm/s) is exceptional—typically ±0.1 mm on taught paths. Combined with FANUC's Constant Path motion mode, which maintains programmed TCP speed through corners and curves, you get uniform bead width even on complex geometries.

For larger parts, we use ABB IRB 4600 or KUKA KR 10 robots with extended reach. On a recent [appliance](/industries/appliances/) gasketing line, an ABB IRB 4600-40/2.55 dispenses a 1,400 mm perimeter gasket on a refrigerator door liner in 9.2 seconds—maintaining ±0.15 mm bead position around 12 corner radii.

### Cartesian Gantry Systems

For planar dispensing on flat or low-profile parts—PCBs, flat gaskets, panels—gantry systems deliver higher speed and better path accuracy than robots at lower cost. We build gantry dispensing systems using Festo, Bosch Rexroth, and IAI linear actuators with ball screw or linear motor drives.

Linear motor gantries hit dispensing speeds of 500+ mm/s with ±0.02 mm path accuracy—significantly better than any articulated robot. On high-volume [electronics](/industries/electronics/) dispensing lines, this speed advantage translates directly to cycle time reduction.

### Fixed-Station Dispensing

Sometimes the simplest approach is the best. For high-volume dedicated lines, a fixed dispensing valve with the part moving underneath on a servo-controlled stage or [rotary dial](/solutions/assembly/) delivers the most compact, reliable solution. We've integrated fixed-station dispensing into dozens of rotary indexing machines where the part indexes to the dispense station, receives material, and indexes out in under 2 seconds.

## Bead Inspection: The Step Most Integrators Skip

Here's a war story. A customer called us to troubleshoot a dispensing system built by another integrator. The system dispensed beautifully during the acceptance run—perfect beads, great cycle time, happy handshakes all around. Six weeks into production, they were rejecting 12% of assemblies at final leak test. The adhesive bead looked fine to the naked eye, but the dispense valve had developed a slow leak that reduced bead volume by 15% over a two-week period. Nobody caught it because there was no bead inspection.

Every dispensing system we build includes at least one of these quality verification methods:

### Vision-Based Bead Inspection

A [machine vision](/solutions/machine-vision/) camera—typically a Keyence CV-X or Cognex In-Sight 2800—images the bead immediately after dispensing and checks width, position, continuity, and presence. We've set up Keyence laser profilers (LJ-X8000 series) to measure bead height and cross-sectional area in real time, catching volume variations that a 2D camera can't detect.

On a form-in-place gasket application, a Keyence LJ-X8080 profiler scans the bead at 64,000 profiles per second as the part moves past the sensor, building a complete 3D map of the gasket. The system catches breaks, thin spots, and volume deficiencies that are invisible to 2D cameras.

### Weight Verification

For potting and encapsulation applications where total dispensed volume matters more than bead geometry, we integrate precision scales (Mettler Toledo or Sartorius) that weigh the part before and after dispensing. Weight verification catches gradual volume drift and material density changes that volumetric monitoring alone misses.

### Flow and Pressure Monitoring

Inline flow meters and pressure transducers provide real-time monitoring of the dispensing process. A sudden pressure drop signals an air bubble, a blocked needle, or a depleted material supply. Continuous pressure trending catches slow degradation—like a worn pump rotor or a partially clogged filter—before it produces defective parts.

## Real-World Application Examples

### Automotive FIPG Gasketing on Transmission Housings

A Tier 1 powertrain supplier needed to apply form-in-place RTV silicone gaskets on aluminum transmission housings. The gasket path is 680 mm in perimeter with 14 corners ranging from 3 mm to 12 mm radius, and the spec required 3.0 mm ±0.3 mm bead width with zero breaks or thin spots. They were running manual dispensing with handheld guns—three operators per shift—and rework rates were running 8–11%.

We built a system around a FANUC M-10iD/12 robot with a Viscotec eco-PEN450 progressive cavity pump and a Keyence LJ-X8060 laser profiler for inline bead inspection. The robot follows a taught path at 120 mm/s with FANUC's Constant Path mode maintaining consistent TCP speed through every corner. The profiler scans the bead 200 ms after dispensing and rejects any part with a width excursion, break, or volume deficiency.

**Results:** 14.2-second cycle time (vs. 55 seconds manual), bead width consistency of ±0.12 mm (well inside the ±0.3 mm spec), zero break defects in over 400,000 parts, material savings of 34% from eliminating over-application. The system eliminated all three manual operators per shift and paid for itself in 11 months running two shifts. Rework dropped from 8–11% to under 0.2%.

### Electronics Conformal Coating on Automotive ECU Boards

An electronics manufacturer producing engine control units for a major automotive OEM needed to selectively conformal coat PCBs—protecting sensitive circuits while keeping connectors, test points, and heatsink pads clear of coating material. Manual spray application was creating overspray contamination on keep-out zones, and masking each board added 45 seconds to the process.

We designed a Cartesian gantry cell with a Nordson ASYMTEK DJ-9500 jet valve for selective coating at 300 mm/s. The system uses a Cognex In-Sight 2800 camera to locate fiducial marks on each board and automatically adjusts the dispense path for board position variation. After coating, a UV inspection station verifies coverage using the fluorescent additive in the conformal coating material.

**Results:** 6.8-second cycle time per board (vs. 52 seconds with manual masking and spray), zero overspray on keep-out zones, 100% coverage verification via UV inspection. Material consumption dropped 42% by eliminating overspray waste. The system runs three product variants with automatic recipe changeover—no operator intervention between batches.

### Medical Device Potting for Implantable Sensor Module

A [medical device](/industries/medical/) manufacturer needed to pot a miniature sensor module with a two-part silicone compound. The fill volume was 0.35 mL ±0.01 mL per unit, and the potting had to be void-free—any trapped air bubble could compromise the hermetic seal required for an implantable device. The process required full 21 CFR Part 11-compliant traceability and was subject to FDA audit.

We built a clean room-compatible station with a Scheugenpflug DosP two-component meter-mix system dispensing at a 1:1 mix ratio with ±0.3% ratio accuracy. The system dispenses into the part cavity under a partial vacuum (50 mbar) to prevent void formation, then returns to atmospheric pressure to ensure complete fill. A Mettler Toledo XPR precision balance verifies fill weight on every unit.

**Results:** 0.35 mL ±0.006 mL actual fill volume (better than the ±0.01 mL spec), zero void defects in over 200,000 units, IQ/OQ/PQ validation completed in 9 weeks. The system generates electronic batch records meeting 21 CFR Part 11 requirements, with every dispense parameter—mix ratio, volume, vacuum level, fill weight—recorded and linked to the unit serial number.

## The ROI of Automated Dispensing

Let's run the numbers. Dispensing automation typically delivers ROI from three distinct buckets, and most customers underestimate the second and third.

**Direct labor savings** are the obvious win. A manual dispensing station requires one skilled operator per shift at a fully burdened cost of $55,000–$65,000/year. If the automated system replaces 2–3 operators (common when one robot replaces multiple manual stations), you're saving $110,000–$195,000/year per shift. On a two-shift operation, that's $220,000–$390,000/year.

**Material savings** are the hidden goldmine. Manual dispensing wastes material through over-application (operators apply extra "just to be safe"), purging between parts, and material that cures in the nozzle during breaks. We consistently measure 30–50% material reduction when switching from manual to automated dispensing. On a high-volume line using a structural adhesive costing $80/liter, a 40% reduction in consumption saves $60,000–$150,000/year.

**Quality cost reduction** closes the loop. Dispensing defects—missed beads, thin spots, wrong volume—cause downstream failures at leak test, final assembly, or worse, in the field. If your current dispensing rework rate is 5% and each rework costs $15 in labor and material, that's $75,000/year on a 100,000-unit line. Dropping rework to under 0.5% saves $67,500/year. For safety-critical bonds in [automotive](/industries/automotive/) or [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/) applications, the cost of a field failure dwarfs these numbers.

A typical single-station robotic dispensing system costs $150,000–$300,000 depending on material system complexity and inspection requirements. Multi-station integrated systems run $300,000–$600,000. We see full payback in **10–18 months** on two-shift operations.

## Common Challenges and How We Solve Them

**"Our adhesive changes viscosity with temperature."** This is the most common dispensing headache, and it's solvable. We integrate heated hoses, heated valves, and material temperature controllers from Nordson and Graco that maintain material temperature within ±1°C from the reservoir to the needle tip. For temperature-sensitive materials like cyanoacrylates, we use chilled dispensing lines. We also select pump technologies (progressive cavity, piston) that are less sensitive to viscosity variation than time-pressure systems.

**"We need to switch between materials on the same system."** We design purge-and-flush systems that clean the fluid path between material changes, and we use quick-disconnect fluid fittings that allow operators to swap material supply in under 5 minutes. For systems that run multiple adhesives on the same line, we've installed dual-valve configurations with separate fluid paths and automatic valve selection via recipe.

**"Our bead needs to follow a 3D contour."** This is where 6-axis [robotic cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/) shine. We teach the dispense path directly on your part geometry using FANUC's touch-sensing or laser-tracker calibration, and we use Constant Path mode to maintain consistent bead width through contours. For parts with significant unit-to-unit variation (castings, molded parts), we add [vision-guided](/solutions/machine-vision/) path correction that adjusts the dispense path in real time based on actual part position.

**"Two-part materials keep curing in the mixer."** Pot life management is critical for 2K systems. We size the static mixer for your flow rate so material doesn't sit in the mixer long enough to gel. Automatic purge cycles flush the mixer at programmed intervals during idle periods. For very short pot-life materials (under 5 minutes), we use dynamic mixers with active cleaning cycles. And we always include mixer pressure monitoring to detect clogs before they become disasters.

**"We're worried about air bubbles in potting applications."** Vacuum dispensing eliminates trapped air. We build enclosed dispensing stations that pull a partial vacuum (typically 10–100 mbar) before and during dispensing, then return to atmospheric pressure to collapse any remaining micro-voids. For the most critical applications—implantable [medical devices](/industries/medical/) and high-reliability electronics—we combine vacuum dispensing with centrifugal degassing of the material before it enters the dispensing system.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What dispense accuracy can I expect from an automated system?

Volumetric accuracy depends on the pump technology. Piston dispensers deliver ±1% or better for dot and shot applications. Progressive cavity pumps hold ±1–2% for continuous bead dispensing. Jetting valves achieve ±3–5% on individual dots but average out to better than ±2% over a full dispense pattern. These numbers assume proper material temperature control and regular maintenance—a worn progressive cavity stator or a partially blocked needle will degrade accuracy quickly.

### How do you handle materials that settle or separate?

Filled materials—adhesives with conductive particles, thermal pastes with ceramic fillers—require continuous agitation in the reservoir to prevent settling. We integrate stirred pressure tanks from Nordson EFD and Graco with variable-speed agitators, and we use recirculation loops on long fluid supply lines to keep filler particles evenly distributed. For two-component systems with different-density components, we agitate each reservoir independently.

### What cycle times are realistic for dispensing operations?

It varies widely by application. A simple dot dispense takes 0.1–0.3 seconds. A 200 mm perimeter gasket bead at 150 mm/s takes about 1.8 seconds including approach and retract. A full PCB conformal coat covering 150 cm² takes 5–8 seconds with a jetting valve. Potting operations depend on fill volume—a 5 mL cavity fill typically takes 3–5 seconds. We optimize cycle time during the design phase and verify it during the factory acceptance test.

### Can the system handle UV-cure adhesives?

Yes. We integrate UV-cure dispensing regularly, especially for [medical device](/industries/medical/) and [electronics](/industries/electronics/) applications. The dispensing system uses amber-tinted reservoirs, opaque tubing, and UV-blocking needle tips to prevent premature cure. We integrate Omron (formerly Loctite/Henkel) UV LED curing systems or Hamamatsu spot curing units downstream of the dispense station for controlled cure exposure. Cure verification uses a UV fluorescence check via [machine vision](/solutions/machine-vision/).

### How often do dispensing valves need maintenance?

Maintenance intervals depend on the material and valve type. Needle valves dispensing clean, unfilled materials can run 1–2 million cycles between rebuilds. Progressive cavity pumps on abrasive or filled materials may need rotor/stator replacement every 3–6 months. Jetting valves require periodic seal replacement depending on material chemistry—typically every 6–12 months. We include preventive maintenance schedules with every system and stock common wear parts for fast turnaround through our [spare parts program](/services/spare-parts/).

### What materials can be dispensed automatically?

Nearly any pumpable material: structural epoxies, cyanoacrylates, UV-cure adhesives, RTV silicones, polyurethane sealants, anaerobic thread lockers, thermal greases, conformal coatings, lubricating oils and greases, solder paste, and potting compounds. The key parameter is viscosity—we need to match the pump technology to the material's rheological properties. We test your specific material during the feasibility phase to confirm dispense performance before committing to a system design. Visit our [consulting services](/services/consulting/) page to learn more about our engineering process.

### Do you integrate dispensing into larger assembly systems?

That's actually how most of our dispensing work happens. The majority of our dispensing stations are integrated into multi-station [assembly systems](/solutions/assembly/)—rotary dials, linear transfer lines, and robotic cells—where dispensing is one operation in a larger assembly sequence. Standalone dispensing cells are less common but we build those too, typically for operations like conformal coating or potting that require dedicated process chambers (vacuum, UV cure, or controlled atmosphere).
