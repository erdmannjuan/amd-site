Machine tending automation keeps your production equipment running with consistent, reliable part loading and unloading. AMD Machines designs [robotic cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/) that tend CNC machines, presses, and other production equipment for maximum utilization.

## Machine Tending Configurations

### Single Machine Cells

One robot serves one machine:

- Compact footprint for limited floor space
- Simple integration and programming
- Ideal for high-value or long-cycle machines
- Easy to implement as first automation step

### Multi-Machine Cells

One robot serves multiple machines:

- Maximize robot utilization
- Balance cycle times across machines
- Reduce per-part automation cost
- Typical configurations: 2-4 machines per robot

### Linear Systems

Robot on rail serves machine line:

- Scalable to many machines
- Flexible capacity adjustment
- Centralized part staging
- Integration with [material handling](/solutions/material-handling/)

## Part Handling Options

- **Conveyors** - Continuous part flow in/out of cell
- **[Bin Picking](/solutions/bin-picking/)** - Pick from bulk containers
- **Pallets** - Organized part presentation
- **Magazines** - High-density part staging

## Quality Integration

Combine tending with quality operations:

- **[Machine Vision](/solutions/machine-vision/)** - Inspect parts before/after machining
- **Gauging** - In-cell dimensional verification
- **Marking** - Part identification and traceability

## Industry Applications

- **[Automotive](/industries/automotive/)** - High-volume powertrain and chassis components
- **[Aerospace](/industries/aerospace/)** - Precision machined flight hardware
- **[Heavy Equipment](/industries/heavy-equipment/)** - Large castings and forgings
- **[Medical](/industries/medical/)** - Implants and surgical instruments
