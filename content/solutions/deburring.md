Automated deburring systems remove unwanted material from part edges with precision and consistency. AMD Machines designs deburring cells that integrate with your production line for reliable edge finishing on machined, stamped, and cast components.

## Deburring Technologies

### Robotic Deburring

Force-controlled robots for complex geometries:

- Constant force along irregular edges
- Adaptive path following
- Tool change for multiple operations
- Suitable for high-mix production

### Abrasive Systems

Brush and wheel deburring for production:

- Wire brush deburring
- Abrasive nylon brushes
- Flap wheels and buffs
- Orbital sanders

### Thermal Deburring (TEM)

For internal and inaccessible burrs:

- Combustion removes all exposed burrs
- Reaches internal passages and holes
- No tool wear concerns
- High throughput batch processing

### Electrochemical Deburring (ECM)

Precision deburring for critical features:

- Controlled material removal
- No mechanical stress
- Consistent edge radius
- Ideal for intersecting holes

## System Integration

Deburring cells integrate with your manufacturing flow:

- **[Robotic Cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/)** - Automated part handling and deburring
- **[Machine Vision](/solutions/machine-vision/)** - Inspect edges before and after
- **[Machine Tending](/solutions/machine-tending/)** - Deburr after CNC operations

## Quality Verification

Ensure deburring quality with:

- **Edge inspection** - Vision systems verify burr removal
- **Dimensional check** - Confirm edge radius specifications
- **Surface finish** - Measure roughness after finishing

## Industry Applications

- **[Automotive](/industries/automotive/)** - Engine, transmission, and chassis components
- **[Aerospace](/industries/aerospace/)** - Flight-critical machined parts
- **[Medical](/industries/medical/)** - Surgical instruments and implants
- **[Heavy Equipment](/industries/heavy-equipment/)** - Hydraulic components and gears
