Thermal joining processes create strong, permanent bonds between plastic components without fasteners or adhesives. AMD Automation designs automated [welding systems](/solutions/welding/) using ultrasonic, hot plate, vibration, and spin welding technologies.

## Thermal Joining Technologies

### Ultrasonic Welding

High-frequency vibration creates frictional heat:

- Weld times under 1 second
- Small, precise weld areas
- Electronics, medical devices, packaging
- Staking, inserting, and spot welding

### Hot Plate Welding

Heated platen melts mating surfaces:

- Large parts and long weld lines
- Fluid reservoirs, tanks, ducts
- Irregular joint geometries
- High-strength structural welds

### Vibration Welding

Linear friction generates heat:

- Very long weld lines (1m+)
- Automotive interior components
- Air intake manifolds
- High-volume production

### Spin Welding

Rotational friction for circular joints:

- Filters and filtration assemblies
- Containers and caps
- Cylindrical housings
- Fast cycle times

## Process Control

Modern thermal welding systems provide:

- Force, amplitude, and energy monitoring
- Weld-by-distance or weld-by-time modes
- Real-time process signature analysis
- Statistical process control
