## Our Story

AMD Automation was founded over 25 years ago with a clear mission: build custom automated machines that solve real manufacturing problems. What began as a small engineering shop has grown into a full-service automation integrator, but our founding principles remain unchanged.

We've earned our reputation one project at a time, delivering reliable automation systems that perform as promised. Our customers return to us again and again because they know we'll solve their problems thoughtfully, build their equipment carefully, and stand behind our work completely.

## Engineering-Driven Culture

At AMD Automation, engineering isn't just a department—it's our culture. Every project begins with thorough analysis and creative problem-solving. We don't simply apply standard solutions; we engineer systems optimized for your specific requirements.

Our team includes specialists in mechanical design, electrical controls, robotics, vision systems, and manufacturing processes. This depth allows us to tackle complex, multi-disciplinary challenges that others avoid.

## Facility & Capabilities

Our 80,000 square foot facility houses everything needed to design, build, and test complete automation systems:

- Engineering offices with advanced CAD and simulation tools
- Full machine shop for precision fabrication
- Large assembly bays for complete system builds
- Dedicated integration and testing areas
- Comprehensive inventory of standard components

Every system undergoes thorough testing at our facility before shipping. We verify cycle times, quality metrics, and safety systems to ensure your equipment performs as expected from day one.

## Our Approach

We believe in partnership, not just transactions. When you work with AMD Automation, you get:

- **Thorough Discovery** - We invest time understanding your process, challenges, and goals
- **Transparent Communication** - Regular updates, honest assessments, and no surprises
- **Collaborative Design** - Your input shapes the solution at every stage
- **Quality Execution** - Careful fabrication, thorough testing, and proper documentation
- **Ongoing Support** - Training, service, and support for the life of your equipment
