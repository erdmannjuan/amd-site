I'll be straightforward: aerospace is the most demanding manufacturing environment we work in, and it's not even close. The tolerances are tighter, the documentation requirements are heavier, the quality consequences are more severe, and the production volumes are lower — which means every system has to be flexible enough to handle dozens of part numbers while maintaining the kind of process control that would satisfy the most rigorous AS9100 auditor on the planet. After three decades building automation for aerospace Tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers, we've learned that the companies who succeed in this industry aren't the ones with the most advanced robots. They're the ones with the best process discipline — and that starts with how their automation is designed.

At AMD Machines, we build [custom automation systems](/solutions/custom-automation/) specifically for the aerospace production environment. That means systems designed around AS9100D quality management from the first concept sketch, with full traceability baked into the architecture rather than bolted on after the fact. Whether you're assembling flight-critical actuators, testing hydraulic manifolds, or inspecting composite structures, we deliver automation that meets the standards your customers and regulators demand.

## Why Aerospace Automation Is Different

If you've run automation in [automotive](/industries/automotive/) or [consumer products](/industries/consumer/) and you think you can apply the same approach to aerospace, you're in for a rude awakening. Here's what makes aero different — and why it matters for how your automation is designed.

### Traceability Isn't Optional — It's the Product

In automotive, traceability is a quality improvement tool. In aerospace, it's a regulatory requirement and a contractual obligation. Every operation on every serial number must be recorded, stored, and retrievable for the life of the aircraft — which can be 30 years or more. That's not a suggestion. That's AS9100D clause 8.5.2, and your customer's quality team will audit it.

Every system we build captures process data at the operation level and ties it to the individual serial number. Torque values on every fastener. Force-displacement curves on every press-fit. Test pressures and leak rates on every hydraulic component. Vision inspection images and pass/fail results on every critical feature. All of it flows through an OPC-UA gateway to your MES or quality database in real-time, and all of it is retrievable by serial number for as long as you need it.

We've had aerospace customers come back to us eight years after a system was installed asking for process data on a specific serial number — and we were able to pull it in minutes because the data architecture was designed for exactly that scenario.

### Low Volume Means Flexibility, Not Simplicity

Aerospace production rates are measured in hundreds or low thousands per year, not hundreds of thousands. A "high volume" aerospace program might be 5,000 units annually. That changes the automation equation fundamentally.

You can't justify a dedicated, single-purpose machine for 5,000 parts a year. You need systems that handle multiple part numbers — sometimes 50 or more — with quick changeover and recipe-driven processes. At the same time, you can't sacrifice process control for flexibility. Every part number still needs its own validated process parameters, its own inspection criteria, and its own traceability records.

We design our aerospace systems around modular, recipe-driven architectures. The operator selects a part number at the HMI, scans the traveler barcode, and the system automatically loads the correct process parameters, tooling offsets, inspection limits, and data recording configuration. Changeover between part numbers takes 2–10 minutes depending on whether physical tooling needs to swap — and we design quick-change fixtures with poka-yoke features to eliminate setup errors.

### The Cost of a Quality Escape Is Catastrophic

In automotive, a quality escape means a warranty claim, maybe a recall. In aerospace, a quality escape can ground a fleet. The financial and reputational consequences are orders of magnitude higher, and that drives a fundamentally different approach to process control and inspection.

We design every aerospace system with the assumption that manual inspection alone is not sufficient. [Machine vision systems](/solutions/machine-vision/) using Cognex In-Sight 9000 and Keyence CV-X series cameras verify critical features at every station. [Test systems](/solutions/test-systems/) check functional performance to aerospace specifications. And process monitoring — force, torque, pressure, temperature — provides a second layer of defense that catches anomalies even when the part looks visually acceptable.

## Aerospace Applications We Build

### Precision Assembly Systems

Aircraft component assembly demands positional accuracy, fastener integrity, and sealant application quality that most industries never encounter. We build [assembly systems](/solutions/assembly/) for aerospace that integrate:

**Automated fastening** with torque-angle monitoring on every fastener. We integrate Atlas Copco and Desoutter smart tools with real-time torque curve analysis — not just final torque value, but the entire tightening signature is recorded and compared against validated limits. A fastener that hits target torque but shows an abnormal curve (indicating cross-threading, galling, or inadequate clamp load) is flagged immediately.

**Automated drilling** with thrust force and spindle torque monitoring. Hole quality in aerospace composites and aluminum alloys is critical — delamination in CFRP or burr formation in aluminum can create stress risers that lead to fatigue failures. We monitor drill thrust and torque in real-time and correlate it with tool wear tracking, so you know when to change the drill before it produces a bad hole.

**Sealant application** using [precision dispensing systems](/solutions/dispensing/) with vision-guided bead inspection. Fay surface sealants on fuel tank joints, windshield seals, and structural bonds all require precise bead geometry and complete coverage. We use Cognex vision to verify bead width, height, and continuity immediately after application — before the sealant cures and rework becomes a multi-hour operation.

On a recent program for a Tier 1 aerostructures supplier, we built an [assembly line](/solutions/assembly/) for a flight control actuator housing that integrated drilling, fastening, sealant application, and leak testing in a single cell. The system handled 12 part variants with changeover times under 5 minutes. First-pass yield improved from 87% (manual assembly) to 99.2% — and the data package for each serial number included over 200 individually recorded parameters.

### Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

NDT is where aerospace separates from every other industry. NADCAP-accredited processes, certified operators, and automated inspection systems that can detect sub-surface defects invisible to the human eye. We integrate NDT equipment into automated handling systems that improve throughput, repeatability, and documentation compared to manual inspection.

**Ultrasonic inspection** for composite structures and bonded assemblies. We integrate Olympus (now Evident) and GE Inspection Technologies phased array systems with FANUC and ABB [robotic cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/) that scan complex 3D geometries automatically. A six-axis robot can maintain probe normal orientation across a compound-curved surface far more consistently than a manual scanner — and the scan data is automatically georeferenced to the part coordinate system for defect mapping.

**Eddy current inspection** for surface and near-surface defects in metallic components. We build automated eddy current systems for fastener hole inspection, surface crack detection, and conductivity measurement on heat-treated aluminum components. Automated scanning eliminates the operator-dependent variability that plagues manual eddy current inspection, and digital data storage replaces strip chart recorders that nobody wants to archive for 30 years.

**X-ray and CT inspection** integration with automated part handling. We design load/unload systems and fixturing for existing X-ray cabinets and CT scanners, automating the part presentation that's typically the bottleneck in radiographic inspection. For a defense contractor, we built an automated X-ray inspection cell that tripled throughput by eliminating manual fixture loading and enabling batch processing of small components.

### Functional Testing

Aerospace components must be tested to prove they meet performance specifications before they ship — no exceptions. We build automated [test systems](/solutions/test-systems/) for:

**Hydraulic component testing** at pressures up to 5,000 PSI. Actuators, valves, manifolds, and fittings all require proof pressure, burst pressure, internal leakage, and external leakage testing per the applicable specification. We integrate Moog and Parker servo-hydraulic test stands with automated part fixturing, so the operator loads the part and walks away while the system runs through a multi-step test sequence — sometimes 15-20 individual tests per part — and generates a complete test report tied to the serial number.

**Pneumatic leak testing** for fuel system components, environmental control system ducting, and pressurized cabin assemblies. We use Ateq and Cincinnati Test Systems leak test instruments integrated with automated clamping fixtures and controlled-environment enclosures. Leak rates down to 1×10⁻⁵ scc/s are routine on our systems.

**Electrical and functional testing** for avionics, actuators, and electromechanical assemblies. Automated test sequences exercise the unit through its full operating envelope — position accuracy, response time, force output, signal integrity — and compare results against specification limits. We integrate National Instruments and Keysight test instrumentation with custom test software that generates AS9102-compliant first article inspection reports.

### Composite Processing Support

Composite structures are the backbone of modern aircraft, and the manufacturing processes — layup, cure, trim, inspect — all benefit from automation. While we don't build autoclaves or ATL/AFP machines, we build the automation around them:

**Post-cure trimming and routing** using FANUC and ABB robots with high-speed spindles. We build [robotic trimming cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/) with dust extraction, tool wear monitoring, and in-process dimensional verification using Keyence laser displacement sensors. Trim accuracy of ±0.15 mm is standard on our systems.

**Layup verification** using structured light scanning to compare the as-laid ply geometry against the engineering model. We integrate GOM (now Zeiss) and Keyence structured light sensors that detect ply wrinkles, gaps, and overlaps before the part goes into the autoclave — when the defect is still correctable.

**Post-inspection marking and serialization** using [laser marking systems](/solutions/marking-traceability/) that apply permanent identification per AMS3360 (laser marking of aerospace metals) and customer-specific standards.

## Process Control and Data Architecture

The data system is the backbone of any aerospace automation installation. Here's how we architect it:

**Layer 1 — Machine Control.** Allen-Bradley ControlLogix or Siemens S7-1500 PLCs controlling real-time machine operations. All critical process parameters (force, torque, pressure, temperature, position) are sampled at 100 Hz minimum and stored in the PLC historian.

**Layer 2 — Station Data.** Each station compiles process data into a structured record tied to the part serial number. Weld-by-weld, fastener-by-fastener, test-by-test — every operation generates a record that includes timestamp, operator ID, tool serial number, and all measured parameters.

**Layer 3 — Line/Cell Integration.** OPC-UA server aggregates data from all stations and makes it available to the plant MES. Part routing, work order management, and hold/release decisions are managed at this level.

**Layer 4 — Enterprise.** Data flows to your quality management system (Solumina, SAP QM, or equivalent) for long-term archival, trend analysis, and regulatory reporting.

We design the data architecture during the concept phase — not after the machine is built — because retrofitting traceability into an existing system is five times more expensive than designing it in from the start.

## ROI in Aerospace Automation

The ROI calculation for aerospace automation is different from high-volume industries. You're not primarily chasing cycle time reduction or labor savings (though those matter). The big wins are:

| Metric | Manual Process | Automated System |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| First-pass yield | 82–92% | 97–99.5% |
| Rework hours per unit | 2–8 hours | 0.1–0.5 hours |
| Data recording compliance | 85–95% (auditor findings) | 100% (automatic) |
| Changeover time (per part number) | 30–90 minutes | 2–10 minutes |
| Nonconformance rate | 3–8% | 0.2–1.0% |

For a typical aerospace assembly program producing 3,000 units per year, the math looks like this:

- **Rework reduction** (from 4 hrs to 0.3 hrs average per unit at $85/hr burdened rate): $945,000/year
- **Scrap reduction** (from 4% to 0.5% on $2,500 average part value): $262,500/year
- **Labor efficiency** (operator utilization improvement): $120,000–$200,000/year
- **Audit and compliance cost reduction**: $50,000–$100,000/year
- **Total annual benefit**: $1.37–$1.51 million/year
- **Typical system investment**: $1.5–$3.0 million
- **Payback period**: 12–24 months

And the intangible benefits — avoiding customer quality escapes, reducing NADCAP findings, and being able to respond to rate increases without hiring and training — often matter more than the direct cost savings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do your systems meet AS9100D requirements?

Our systems are designed to support AS9100D compliance at every level. Process control, calibration management, data collection, and documentation are built into the system architecture from the concept phase. We provide complete validation documentation packages including IQ/OQ/PQ protocols, calibration certificates, and user requirement specifications. While the AS9100 certification belongs to your organization, our equipment is designed to make your compliance straightforward.

### Can you integrate with our existing MES and quality systems?

Yes. We use OPC-UA as our standard communication protocol, which interfaces with virtually every modern MES platform — Solumina, SAP Manufacturing Execution, Plex, DELMIA Apriso, and others. For legacy systems, we support OPC-DA, SQL database direct write, and custom API interfaces. We define the data exchange specification during the design phase and validate it during factory acceptance testing.

### How do you handle ITAR-controlled programs?

We understand the requirements of ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) and work with our customers to implement appropriate controls. This includes restricted network access for ITAR systems (air-gapped or dedicated VLANs), controlled access to PLC programs and HMI recipes, and documentation handling per your facility's Technology Control Plan. All AMD Machines employees working on ITAR programs are U.S. persons as defined by the regulation.

### What robot brands do you integrate for aerospace?

We're a FANUC Authorized System Integrator and also integrate ABB, KUKA, and Yaskawa robots depending on the application requirements. For aerospace NDT scanning, FANUC's LR Mate and M-20 series are our most common platforms due to their path accuracy (±0.02 mm repeatability). For larger structural assembly applications, we use ABB IRB 6700 and FANUC M-900 series robots with secondary encoders for enhanced path accuracy. The robot selection is always driven by the application requirements — reach, payload, accuracy, and clean-room compatibility.

### How long do your aerospace systems last?

We design for 20-30 year service life, which matches typical aerospace production program durations. That means specifying industrial-grade components with long availability windows, maintaining spare parts lists with recommended stocking levels, and designing the system architecture so individual components can be replaced without redesigning the entire system. We also provide obsolescence management plans that identify long-lead and end-of-life components and recommend technology refresh schedules.

### What's the typical lead time for an aerospace automation system?

System complexity drives the timeline. A standalone test cell might be 6–8 months from order to acceptance. A multi-station assembly line with full MES integration and validation documentation is typically 10–14 months. We provide detailed project schedules during the proposal phase and conduct weekly progress reviews throughout the build. Factory acceptance testing (FAT) is always conducted at our facility before we ship to your site, so we catch issues in our shop — not on your production floor.

### Do you provide validation documentation for aerospace systems?

Every aerospace system ships with a comprehensive documentation package: design specifications, electrical schematics, pneumatic/hydraulic diagrams, PLC source code, HMI project files, operator manuals, maintenance manuals, calibration procedures, and spare parts lists. For systems requiring formal validation, we develop and execute IQ (Installation Qualification), OQ (Operational Qualification), and PQ (Performance Qualification) protocols tailored to your quality system requirements. The documentation package is reviewed and approved by your quality team during the design review process.

## Working With AMD Machines on Aerospace Programs

We've been building [custom automation](/solutions/custom-automation/) for aerospace manufacturers for over 30 years. We understand that aerospace programs move differently than commercial manufacturing — longer development cycles, more design reviews, more documentation, more stakeholders. We're built for that. Our project management approach includes formal design reviews at concept, preliminary, and critical design milestones, with action item tracking and customer sign-off at each gate.

If you're evaluating automation for an aerospace manufacturing program, [contact us](/contact/) to discuss your requirements. We'll start with a manufacturing assessment to understand your process, your quality requirements, and your production volumes — and we'll tell you honestly whether automation makes sense for your application.
