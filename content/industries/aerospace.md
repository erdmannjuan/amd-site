Aerospace manufacturing demands uncompromising quality, complete traceability, and systems built to support long production programs. AMD Automation delivers automation solutions that meet these exacting requirements.

## AS9100 Quality

We design and build systems that support AS9100 quality management:

- Process control for critical characteristics
- Comprehensive data collection and storage
- Calibration management support
- First article inspection capabilities

## Traceability

Aerospace traceability requirements drive our data systems:

- Unique part identification tracking
- Operation-by-operation data capture
- Parameter recording for every process
- Integration with MES and quality systems

## Low Volume Flexibility

Unlike high-volume automotive production, aerospace often involves lower volumes with many configurations. Our systems accommodate:

- Multiple part variants on single systems
- Long changeover cycles between programs
- Manual assist stations where appropriate
- Growth provisions for production rate increases

## Defense and Space

For defense and space applications, we understand additional requirements:

- ITAR compliance considerations
- Customer-specific security requirements
- Extended documentation retention
- Obsolescence management planning

## Applications

Our aerospace experience includes:

- Fuselage and wing structure assembly
- Landing gear component manufacturing
- Flight control actuator assembly
- Engine component production
- Interior component manufacturing
- Avionics and electronics assembly
