Food and beverage manufacturing requires automation that prioritizes food safety while delivering the efficiency needed to compete. AMD Automation builds systems that meet both requirements.

## Sanitary Design

Our food and beverage systems incorporate sanitary design principles:

- Stainless steel construction (304/316)
- Sloped surfaces for drainage
- Sealed bearings and motors
- Washdown-rated components (IP65/IP69K)
- No horizontal surfaces for debris accumulation
- Easy disassembly for cleaning

## Food Safety Compliance

We design systems that support your food safety programs:

- FSMA compliance considerations
- HACCP critical control point monitoring
- SQF and BRC audit readiness
- Allergen changeover efficiency
- CIP/COP integration

## Packaging Automation

End-of-line packaging is a key opportunity for automation:

- Form-fill-seal integration
- Cartoning and case packing
- Shrink bundling and wrapping
- Tray loading and lidding
- Palletizing and stretch wrapping

## Inspection Systems

Protecting consumers and your brand:

- Vision inspection for fill level, cap presence, label verification
- X-ray detection for contaminants
- Metal detection integration
- Checkweighing
- Leak detection
