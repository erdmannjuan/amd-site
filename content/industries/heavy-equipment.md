Heavy equipment manufacturing requires automation that handles oversized components, delivers structural weld quality, and adapts to varying production volumes. AMD Machines provides solutions scaled for construction, agricultural, and mining equipment production.

## Structural Welding Automation

Heavy equipment frames and structural components require robust [welding automation](/solutions/welding/):

- Multi-robot cells for large weldments
- Positioners and manipulators for optimal weld access
- High-deposition MIG and flux-cored welding
- Weld quality monitoring and documentation

## Machine Tending for Large Parts

[Robotic machine tending](/solutions/machine-tending/) for heavy equipment components:

- Large CNC mill and lathe loading
- Casting and forging handling from [bins](/solutions/bin-picking/)
- Multi-machine cell configurations
- Integration with part washing and inspection

## Assembly Automation

Assembly solutions scaled for heavy equipment:

- [Servo pressing](/solutions/servo-pressing/) for bearing and bushing installation
- [Automated fastening](/solutions/screwdriving/) with torque documentation
- [Dispensing](/solutions/dispensing/) for sealants and adhesives
- Guided assembly with [vision verification](/solutions/machine-vision/)

## Material Handling

Moving large, heavy components requires specialized [material handling](/solutions/material-handling/):

- High-payload robots (500+ kg)
- Overhead gantry systems
