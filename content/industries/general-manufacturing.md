Here's a truth that 30 years of building automation has taught us: the most interesting projects we've ever built didn't come from automotive, medical, or aerospace. They came from manufacturers who called us and said, "We don't think anyone can automate this." That's when things get fun.

AMD Machines has delivered over 2,500 custom automation systems, and a significant portion of those went to manufacturers who don't fit cleanly into a single industry category. Companies making hydraulic valves, HVAC components, plumbing fixtures, power tools, electric motors, sporting goods, furniture hardware, industrial fasteners — the list goes on. What they all have in common is a production challenge that off-the-shelf equipment can't solve and a competitor breathing down their neck.

If you make a physical product and you're running out of people, floor space, or quality patience, we can help. That's the short version. Here's the longer one.

## Why General Manufacturing Is Actually the Hardest Automation

Counterintuitive, right? You'd think [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/) with its AS9100 requirements or [medical devices](/industries/medical/) with FDA validation would be the toughest automation challenges. And they're demanding — but they're demanding in predictable ways. The standards tell you what to build, and the volumes are usually manageable.

General manufacturing is different. There's no industry standard telling you how to automate a hydraulic manifold assembly. No reference architecture for building a lawn mower blade heat-treat cell. No off-the-shelf solution for inspecting cast-iron pump housings at 900 parts per hour. Every system is genuinely custom, designed from a blank sheet of paper based on the specific product, process, volume, and quality requirements of that particular customer.

That's why we call ourselves a custom machine builder and not an equipment supplier. We don't have a catalog. We have engineers who know how to look at a manufacturing problem and figure out the right combination of [robotic cells](/solutions/robotic-cells/), [assembly stations](/solutions/assembly/), [vision systems](/solutions/machine-vision/), and [test equipment](/solutions/test-systems/) to solve it.

## What We Build: Core Automation Capabilities

### Robotic Work Cells

The robotic workcell is our bread and butter. A robot (or robots) in a guarded cell with custom tooling, fixtures, and controls designed to perform one or more operations on your parts. We're a FANUC Authorized System Integrator, and FANUC is our go-to platform for most applications — the M-20iD/25 for general material handling and machine tending, the Arc Mate 120iD for welding, the LR Mate 200iD for small-part assembly and inspection, and the M-710iC or R-2000iC for heavy payloads. We also integrate ABB, KUKA, and Yaskawa robots when the application or customer preference calls for it.

A single-robot [machine tending cell](/solutions/machine-tending/) for loading and unloading a CNC lathe might cost $150,000-$250,000 and pay for itself in 10-14 months by eliminating one operator per shift. A multi-robot welding cell with dual turntable positioners, seam tracking, and weld quality monitoring might run $400,000-$700,000 — but it replaces three manual welders and improves weld quality consistency from 92% first-pass yield to 99.5%.

**Real-World Example: Hydraulic Valve Body Assembly**
A manufacturer of hydraulic control valves came to us producing 30 variants of a valve body assembly that required pressing in 4-8 sleeves, driving 6-12 screws, dispensing thread sealant, and running a functional flow test — all in a single cell. Manual assembly took 4.5 minutes per unit with 2 operators, and they were seeing a 3.2% rework rate driven by missed sealant, cross-threaded fasteners, and under-pressed sleeves. We built an integrated cell with a FANUC M-20iD/25 robot handling parts between stations: a [servo press](/solutions/servo-pressing/) with force-displacement monitoring for sleeve insertion, a [multi-spindle screwdriving station](/solutions/screwdriving/) with Atlas Copco Power Focus 6000 controllers for torque-angle verification, a Nordson [dispensing system](/solutions/dispensing/) with Cognex vision verification for thread sealant, and a custom flow test stand. The cell produces a unit every 78 seconds with one operator loading raw components. First-pass yield: 99.6%. The rework bench now collects dust.

### Assembly Systems

[Assembly systems](/solutions/assembly/) are where AMD Machines really differentiates. We've been building assembly automation since our founding, and it's our core expertise. From simple single-station semi-automatic presses to 40-station fully automatic lines, we design systems that combine multiple operations into an integrated production flow.

Our assembly systems typically integrate:

- **Servo pressing** with force-displacement curve monitoring for press-fit operations. Our [servo press systems](/solutions/servo-pressing/) use Promess, Kistler, and Schmidt presses that generate complete force-displacement signatures for every cycle — not just peak force, but the entire curve profile that tells you whether the press was good, marginal, or a reject.
- **Automated fastening** using Atlas Copco, Desoutter, and Stanley torque controllers with multi-step tightening strategies. [Screwdriving systems](/solutions/screwdriving/) with torque-angle-gradient monitoring catch cross-threading, stripped threads, and inadequate clamp load in real-time.
- **Dispensing** for adhesives, sealants, lubricants, and potting compounds. Precision [dispensing systems](/solutions/dispensing/) with volumetric flow control and vision-verified bead inspection.
- **Testing** integrated at multiple points in the assembly process. Don't wait until end-of-line to find a bad part — test after each critical operation so you catch failures early and know exactly which operation caused them.

### Vision Inspection and Quality Verification

Automated inspection has transformed what's possible in quality control. Ten years ago, visual inspection meant a human being staring at parts under fluorescent lights. Today, [machine vision systems](/solutions/machine-vision/) with Cognex In-Sight and Keyence CV-X cameras running AI-based defect detection can inspect parts at 1,200 per hour with detection rates that exceed human inspectors by 30-40%.

We build vision inspection systems for:

- **Dimensional measurement**: Non-contact gauging using Keyence LJ-X8000 profile scanners and 3D structured light systems. Measure 50+ features per part in under 3 seconds with ±0.01mm repeatability.
- **Defect detection**: Surface defects, scratches, dents, porosity, flash, and contamination. AI-trained vision models learn what "good" looks like and flag anything that deviates — including defect types you haven't even seen yet.
- **Assembly verification**: Confirm component presence, orientation, color, and label content. Make sure every screw is driven, every clip is seated, every label is applied correctly.
- **Traceability**: Read and verify 1D/2D barcodes, Data Matrix codes, and laser marks. Link every inspection result to a unique serial number for complete [marking and traceability](/solutions/marking-traceability/).

### Material Handling and Logistics

Getting parts from point A to point B inside your plant sounds simple until you realize that every damaged part, every misrouted component, and every operator walking to the stockroom costs money. [Material handling automation](/solutions/material-handling/) — conveyors, robots, AGVs, and automated storage systems — keeps parts moving without damage, delay, or human error.

[Robotic bin picking](/solutions/bin-picking/) using 3D vision (Cognex, Photoneo, or SICK sensors) picks randomly oriented parts from bins and presents them to downstream operations in consistent orientation. [Palletizing systems](/solutions/palletizing/) handle end-of-line packaging with FANUC M-410iC or ABB IRB 460 robots stacking cases at rates up to 30 cases per minute.

**Real-World Example: Electric Motor Assembly Line**
An electric motor manufacturer needed to go from 400 motors per shift with 8 operators to 1,000 motors per shift with 3 operators. We designed and built a 16-station assembly line integrating: automated stator and rotor loading from magazines, shaft press-fit with servo press monitoring, bearing installation, end-bell assembly with automated screwdriving, [rotor magnetization and testing](/solutions/test-systems/), lead wire routing and termination, hipot testing at 1,500V, and final functional run test including current draw, speed, and vibration measurement. The system runs at 28-second cycle time with automatic model changeover (the line builds 6 motor variants) driven by barcode scanning at the first station. Annual production: 480,000 motors. First-pass yield: 98.9%.

## The AMD Approach: How We Solve Problems You Haven't Seen Before

When you call us with a manufacturing problem that doesn't have an obvious off-the-shelf solution, here's what happens:

1. **Discovery**: We visit your plant, watch your process, measure your parts, and talk to your operators. The operators always know things the engineers don't — they know which parts are hard to handle, which process step causes the most rework, and which fixture is held together with prayer and C-clamps.

2. **Concept Development**: We develop 2-3 automation concepts with different levels of automation and investment. Sometimes the right answer is full automation. Sometimes it's a semi-automatic system with error-proofing that keeps an operator in the loop for the tricky steps and automates the repetitive ones.

3. **Simulation and Validation**: For robotic cells, we simulate in FANUC ROBOGUIDE or ABB RobotStudio to validate cycle time, reach, and interference before cutting steel. For complex assembly processes, we build proof-of-concept fixtures and run process trials in our lab.

4. **Design and Build**: Mechanical, electrical, and controls design happens in our engineering department. We build the equipment in our facility, debug it on our floor, and run your actual production parts through it before it ships.

5. **Installation and Launch**: On-site installation, commissioning, debug, and operator training. We stay until the system is running at rate and your team is confident.

6. **Ongoing Support**: [Maintenance programs](/services/maintenance-support/), spare parts, remote diagnostics, and [training](/services/training/) for the life of the equipment.

## ROI and Business Case: The Math That Justifies the Investment

Here's the straightforward business case for manufacturing automation. The exact numbers vary by application, but these ranges are representative of what we see across hundreds of projects:

| Metric | Before Automation | After Automation |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Cycle time | 60-180 seconds | 15-60 seconds |
| OEE | 60-75% | 82-92% |
| First-pass yield | 94-97% | 98.5-99.7% |
| Direct labor per line | 4-8 operators | 1-3 operators |
| Scrap rate | 2-5% | 0.2-0.8% |
| Floor space efficiency | Baseline | 30-50% reduction |

**Labor savings** are the most obvious benefit. Replacing 4 operators across two shifts at $38/hour fully loaded (wages, benefits, overhead) saves approximately $630,000 per year. If you're running three shifts, that number climbs to $950,000.

**Quality improvement** is often worth more than labor savings but harder to quantify upfront. Reducing your internal scrap rate from 3% to 0.5% on a product with $15 material cost at 500,000 units per year saves $187,500 in scrap alone — and that doesn't include the rework labor, customer returns, warranty claims, and reputation damage from shipping bad parts.

**Throughput increase** from the same floor space defers capital investment in building expansion. If automation doubles your output per square foot, you've potentially avoided a $2-5 million facility expansion.

**Typical payback periods**: 12-18 months for high-volume applications (250,000+ units/year), 18-30 months for mid-volume (50,000-250,000 units/year), and 24-36 months for lower-volume/high-mix applications where the automation is justified by quality improvement and labor availability rather than pure throughput.

## Common Challenges and How We Handle Them

### High Product Mix and Frequent Changeovers

Most general manufacturers don't run one product — they run dozens or hundreds of variants. The automation has to handle model changeovers efficiently without killing your uptime. We design systems with recipe-driven processes, quick-change tooling using Schunk VERO-S zero-point clamping, and automatic fixture identification using RFID tags. Changeover from one product variant to another takes 2-5 minutes for mechanical changes and zero time for software — the system reads the part barcode or fixture RFID and loads the correct program automatically.

### Parts That Are Hard to Handle

Floppy parts, oily parts, parts with complex geometry, parts that stick together — we've seen it all. The solution is always in the end-of-arm tooling and part presentation. We design custom grippers using Schunk PGN-plus and pneumatic solutions, vacuum grippers with conformable cups for irregular surfaces, and mechanical part feeders or vision-guided [bin picking](/solutions/bin-picking/) systems for bulk-fed components.

### Integrating with Legacy Equipment

Your existing CNC machines, presses, ovens, and test equipment don't need to be replaced to add automation. We routinely integrate robots and conveyors with equipment that's 10-20 years old using hardwired I/O, serial communication, or Ethernet adapters. If it has a way to send and receive signals, we can automate around it.

### Justifying the Investment for Mid-Volume Products

Not every product runs 500,000 units per year. For mid-volume products (25,000-100,000/year), the ROI case shifts from pure labor replacement to quality improvement, capacity flexibility, and labor availability. When you can't find operators willing to work second and third shift, automation isn't a luxury — it's the only way to meet delivery commitments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### We make a niche product — can you really automate it?

In 30 years, we've automated products ranging from fire hydrants to fishing reels, from brake calipers to barbecue burners. If your product is a physical object that gets assembled, tested, packaged, or processed in repeatable steps, we can automate some or all of those steps. The first conversation is free — call us and describe your challenge, and we'll tell you honestly whether automation makes sense.

### How do we know if our volumes justify automation?

As a rough guide, if you're producing more than 25,000 units per year and the product has at least a 3-year production life, there's probably an automation solution that pencils out. Below that, semi-automatic workstations with error-proofing often provide the best balance of investment and return. We'll run the ROI calculation with your actual numbers during the concept phase — no guessing.

### What robot brands do you work with?

We're a FANUC Authorized System Integrator, and FANUC is our primary platform — their reliability is unmatched, their controller architecture is mature, and their support network is the broadest in North America. We also integrate ABB (strong in welding and painting), KUKA (common in European customer specifications), Yaskawa Motoman (good value in palletizing and handling), and Omron/Techman collaborative robots for applications requiring close human-robot interaction.

### Can you automate just part of our process?

Absolutely. Not every automation project needs to be a lights-out factory. We frequently build single-station cells that automate one bottleneck operation — a press-fit station, a weld cell, a test stand — while the rest of the process remains manual. Start with the operation that has the biggest quality problem or the longest cycle time, prove the ROI, and expand from there.

### What does the project timeline look like?

A single-robot workcell typically runs 12-16 weeks from order to shipment. Multi-station assembly systems take 16-28 weeks depending on complexity. We provide a detailed project schedule during the proposal phase so you know exactly what to expect. Every project includes Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) at our facility before we ship, so you see the system running your parts before it arrives at your plant.

### Do you provide after-sale support?

Every system we build comes with warranty coverage, spare parts recommendations, and technical support. Beyond that, we offer ongoing [maintenance and support programs](/services/maintenance-support/), [operator and maintenance training](/services/training/), remote diagnostics, and [spare parts supply](/services/spare-parts/). We've been supporting some customers' equipment for 20+ years — we don't disappear after installation.

### How do you handle intellectual property and confidentiality?

We sign NDAs before seeing your products and processes. Your tooling designs, process parameters, and production data are proprietary and stay that way. We build equipment for competitors in the same industry all the time — the systems are custom, and what we learn on your project stays with your project.
