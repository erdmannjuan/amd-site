Medical device manufacturing demands the highest levels of precision, cleanliness, and documentation. AMD Automation builds automation systems that meet these requirements while delivering the productivity you need.

## Regulatory Expertise

We understand the regulatory environment of medical device manufacturing:

- **21 CFR Part 11** - Our control systems support electronic records and signatures with appropriate access controls, audit trails, and data integrity.
- **ISO 13485** - Systems designed to support your quality management system requirements.
- **FDA Validation** - We provide documentation packages that support your IQ/OQ/PQ validation protocols.

## Clean Room Compatibility

For clean room applications, we design systems with:

- Stainless steel construction and appropriate surface finishes
- Clean room compatible components and materials
- Minimized particle generation
- Easy cleaning access
- Laminar flow integration when required

## Traceability

Medical device regulations require complete traceability. Our systems capture and record:

- Component lot and serial numbers
- Process parameters for every operation
- Test results with pass/fail status
- Operator identification
- Timestamps for all events

Data integrates with your MES/ERP systems for complete device history records.

## Applications

We've built medical device automation for:

- Surgical instrument assembly
- Diagnostic device assembly
- Drug delivery device production
- Implantable device manufacturing
- In-vitro diagnostic equipment
- Medical electronics assembly
