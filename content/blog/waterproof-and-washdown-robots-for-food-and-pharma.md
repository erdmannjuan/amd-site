## Why Standard Robots Can't Handle Washdown Environments

Drop a standard industrial robot into a meat processing facility, and you've got a problem. High-pressure hot water, caustic cleaning chemicals, and daily sanitation cycles will destroy conventional seals, corrode exposed fasteners, and short out connectors within weeks. It's not a matter of if — it's when.

Food and pharma facilities operate under strict hygiene regulations (think USDA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, EHEDG guidelines) that demand thorough daily — sometimes hourly — cleaning. That means every piece of equipment on the line needs to survive direct spray-down with water at 80°C and chemical sanitizers. Standard robots with their painted carbon steel frames, exposed cabling, and ventilation openings simply weren't designed for this.

That's where washdown-rated robots come in. These machines are purpose-built to handle the harshest sanitation protocols without compromising performance or uptime.

## IP Ratings Decoded: What Actually Matters

You'll see IP ratings thrown around constantly, but here's what they actually mean for your application:

**IP65** — Protected against low-pressure water jets from any direction. Fine for light splash zones, but won't survive a direct washdown hose. Some facilities use IP65 robots in secondary areas away from direct sanitation zones.

**IP67** — Can be fully submerged in water up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. This is the baseline for most food processing environments. Robots like the FANUC M-20iD/25 and ABB IRB 1200 offer IP67 variants that handle routine washdowns well.

**IP69K** — The gold standard. Withstands high-pressure (100 bar), high-temperature (80°C) steam cleaning at close range. If your facility runs CIP/COP (clean-in-place/clean-out-of-place) protocols or you're in dairy, poultry, or ready-to-eat production, IP69K is what you need. Stäubli's HE (Humid Environment) line and KUKA's Hygienic Oil series are built specifically for this rating.

One thing people miss: IP ratings only cover water and dust ingress. They don't address chemical resistance. A robot rated IP69K can still corrode if its housing materials can't handle your specific sanitizing agents — peracetic acid, chlorinated alkaline cleaners, quaternary ammonium compounds. Always verify material compatibility separately.

## Hygienic Design Features That Matter

An IP rating alone doesn't make a robot food-safe. True hygienic design goes much deeper:

**Stainless steel construction.** The best washdown robots use 304 or 316L stainless steel housings. 316L is preferred in pharmaceutical and dairy environments because of its superior resistance to chloride-induced pitting. Stäubli's TX2-60L HE uses a fully enclosed 316L stainless body — no paint to chip, no carbon steel to corrode.

**Smooth, crevice-free surfaces.** Bacteria love to hide in bolt heads, seams, and recessed labels. Hygienic robots eliminate these harborage points with smooth contours, concealed fasteners, and rounded transitions between surfaces. Look for EHEDG-certified designs if you're in European markets.

**Food-grade lubricants.** Standard robot grease is petroleum-based and absolutely cannot contact food products. Washdown robots use NSF H1-rated lubricants throughout — so even if a seal fails, there's no contamination risk. KUKA's HO (Hygienic Oil) robots take this further with a fully sealed lubrication system.

**Internal cable routing.** Every external cable is a surface that needs cleaning and a potential failure point. The best washdown robots route all cabling internally, with sealed connectors rated to the same IP standard as the robot body.

**Positive pressure systems.** Some robots (notably Stäubli and certain FANUC models) maintain slight positive air pressure inside the arm, preventing moisture ingress even if a seal degrades. It's a smart backup that extends service intervals.

## Picking the Right Robot for Your Application

Food and pharma applications vary wildly, and there's no single washdown robot that fits every scenario. Here's how to think about selection:

**Primary processing (cutting, deboning, portioning):** You're dealing with raw protein, heavy contamination, and aggressive cleaning. IP69K with 316L stainless is non-negotiable. Delta robots from ABB (IRB 360 FlexPicker in washdown config) or Stäubli (TP80 HE) dominate high-speed pick-and-place here. Cycle times under 0.4 seconds are typical for primary protein sorting.

**Packaging and palletizing:** Once product is sealed, sanitation requirements often drop to IP67. This opens up more cost-effective options. A FANUC M-710iC in IP67 washdown spec handles case packing at 15-20 cycles per minute without the premium cost of full stainless construction. For end-of-line [palletizing](/solutions/palletizing/), standard IP65 may even suffice if the robot sits outside the washdown zone.

**Pharmaceutical cleanrooms:** Different challenge entirely. It's not about surviving water — it's about not introducing particles. Pharma-grade robots need smooth surfaces, minimal particle generation, and compatibility with ISO Class 5-7 cleanroom environments. Stäubli's TX2 line is the industry standard here, with validated particle emission data. Some facilities also run [machine vision inspection](/solutions/machine-vision/) on the line to verify fill levels and label placement.

**Dairy and beverage:** Constant wet environments with daily CIP cycles. IP69K is standard. But watch out for condensation — robots transitioning between cold storage (2-4°C) and ambient temps will sweat, and that moisture can cause issues with connectors and teach pendants. Specify cold-environment packages where available.

## Total Cost: Beyond the Sticker Price

Washdown robots cost more upfront — typically 20-40% above their standard equivalents. An IP67 FANUC CR-15iA runs roughly $55K-65K versus $40K-50K for the standard version. IP69K stainless models from Stäubli can push $80K-100K+ for a 6-axis arm.

But the real math isn't about purchase price. It's about what happens when a standard robot fails in a sanitation zone. One contamination event in a ready-to-eat facility can trigger a recall costing millions. A single unplanned downtime event during peak production — say, Thanksgiving week in a turkey processing plant — can mean six figures in lost product.

Washdown robots also save on maintenance. Standard robots retrofitted with protective covers and aftermarket seals need constant attention — cover replacements, seal inspections, corrosion touch-ups. Purpose-built washdown robots are designed to run 8,000+ hours between major service intervals even with daily high-pressure cleaning.

The sweet spot for most food processors is standardizing on IP67 as the minimum across the facility and stepping up to IP69K in primary processing zones. This avoids the headache of tracking which robots can and can't tolerate which cleaning protocols.
