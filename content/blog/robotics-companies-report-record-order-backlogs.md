If you've tried ordering a new robot lately, you already know the punchline: lead times are brutal. FANUC, ABB, Yaskawa, KUKA — across the board, major manufacturers are reporting order backlogs that stretch 12 to 18 months for many models. Some specialty configurations are pushing past 24 months. And unlike the pandemic-era supply chain crunch, this isn't about component shortages. It's demand.

The numbers tell the story. North American robot orders hit $2.3 billion in the first half of 2025, up 28% year-over-year according to the Association for Advancing Automation (A3). Global installations are on pace to exceed 600,000 units for the year. That's a lot of robots, and the factories that build them simply can't keep up.

## What's Driving the Surge

Three factors are converging to create unprecedented demand:

**Labor economics have crossed a tipping point.** Manufacturing wages in the US have increased 22% since 2020, and more critically, the available labor pool keeps shrinking. The National Association of Manufacturers estimates 2.1 million manufacturing jobs will go unfilled by 2030. At some point, the math stops working without automation, and a lot of companies hit that point simultaneously.

**EV and battery manufacturing buildouts.** The Inflation Reduction Act kicked off a massive wave of new factory construction, and those facilities need robots — lots of them. A single EV battery gigafactory can require 200-400 robots for cell assembly, module construction, and pack building. With 15+ gigafactories under construction in North America alone, that's thousands of robots that weren't in the pipeline two years ago.

**Reshoring and nearshoring.** Companies bringing production back from Asia aren't building 1990s-style labor-intensive factories. They're building heavily automated facilities from day one. A reshored electronics assembly operation might run 3x the robot density compared to what it would have 10 years ago.

## Which Robots Are Hardest to Get

Not all robots are equally backordered. Here's what we're seeing in practice:

**6-axis robots in the 20-50kg payload range** have the longest waits. This is the sweet spot for [assembly](/solutions/assembly/), machine tending, and material handling — which is exactly why demand is so high. FANUC's M-20iD and ABB's IRB 4600 series are particularly constrained.

**Collaborative robots** are in slightly better shape, partly because Universal Robots, FANUC, and ABB have all expanded cobot production capacity over the past two years. Lead times for UR10e and UR20 models are running 8-12 weeks, which is manageable for most project timelines.

**SCARA robots** are the easiest to source right now. Epson, Omron, and FANUC all have relatively short lead times (4-8 weeks) for standard SCARA configurations. If your application can work with a SCARA's 4-axis envelope, that's worth considering as an alternative.

**Large-payload robots (100kg+)** used for palletizing and heavy material handling are running 10-14 months. [Palletizing](/solutions/palletizing/) projects that used to take 6 months from order to production are now stretching past a year.

## How Smart Integrators Are Navigating the Crunch

The backlog reality has changed how automation projects need to be planned. Here's what's working:

**Order robots before finalizing cell design.** This feels backwards, but when your lead time item is 14 months out, you can't afford to wait until engineering is complete to place the PO. Experienced integrators are specifying the robot model and payload class early, ordering it, and finalizing the cell layout and tooling while waiting for delivery. The robot arrives, and integration begins immediately.

**Maintain relationships with multiple OEMs.** Single-sourcing robots made sense when lead times were 6-8 weeks. It doesn't make sense when one manufacturer is at 16 months and another is at 10. Being able to spec an ABB or a FANUC (or a Yaskawa) for a given application gives you flexibility to go with whoever can deliver first.

**Consider refurbished robots for less-critical applications.** A refurbished FANUC R-2000iC with new servos, cables, and a fresh calibration can deliver 95% of the performance at 60% of the cost — and ship in 4-6 weeks. For [machine tending](/solutions/machine-tending/) or basic material handling where you don't need the latest model, refurbished units are a legitimate option.

**Pre-buy for known future projects.** If your capital plan includes automation investments for the next 18-24 months, it may make sense to place orders now, even if the project details aren't fully defined. A FANUC M-710iC in stock is an asset. One that's 14 months away is a bottleneck.

## What This Means for Project Timelines

Let's be realistic about what these backlogs mean for a typical automation project:

A standard [robotic cell](/solutions/robotic-cells/) that might have gone from concept to production in 6-8 months two years ago now realistically takes 12-16 months. The engineering, controls work, and integration haven't gotten slower — it's purely the robot delivery that's pushing timelines.

For manufacturers planning capital projects, the implication is clear: start earlier. If you're budgeting an automation investment for fiscal year 2026, the engineering and procurement process should be underway now. Waiting for budget approval in Q1 and then starting procurement means you're looking at a Q3 or Q4 2027 installation at best.

The companies in the best position are the ones with multi-year automation roadmaps. They're placing orders in waves, staging deliveries to match facility readiness, and keeping their integration partners engaged on a continuous basis rather than project-by-project.

## Will Lead Times Improve?

The major OEMs are investing heavily in production capacity. FANUC opened a new factory in Oshino, Japan. ABB expanded its Shanghai robotics facility. Yaskawa is building additional capacity in Slovenia. But these expansions take time to ramp, and demand isn't slowing down.

The honest answer: don't expect sub-8-week lead times for popular 6-axis models anytime in 2026. Plan accordingly, order early, and work with an integrator who has strong OEM relationships and the ability to adapt when delivery schedules shift. That flexibility is worth more than it's ever been.
