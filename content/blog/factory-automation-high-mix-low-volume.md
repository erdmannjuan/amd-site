Traditional automation was designed for high-volume, low-mix production—making millions of identical parts efficiently. But many manufacturers face the opposite challenge: producing smaller quantities of many different products. This high-mix, low-volume (HMLV) environment presents unique automation challenges and opportunities.

## The HMLV Challenge

High-mix, low-volume manufacturers deal with:

- Dozens or hundreds of different products
- Batch sizes from one to thousands
- Frequent changeovers between products
- Varying processes for different items
- Demand variability and short lead times

Traditional fixed automation struggles in this environment. The changeover time between products can consume the time saved by automation, making the investment difficult to justify.

## Why Automate HMLV Production?

Despite the challenges, automation delivers real value in HMLV environments:

### Labor Availability

Finding and retaining skilled operators is increasingly difficult. Automation reduces dependence on labor that may not be available.

### Quality Consistency

Even with skilled operators, variation exists. Automation delivers consistent quality across product changes.

### Documentation and Traceability

Many HMLV manufacturers serve aerospace, medical, or other industries requiring extensive documentation. Automated systems capture this data automatically.

### Competitive Advantage

Flexible automation enables faster response to customer needs and shorter lead times—key differentiators in HMLV markets.

## Strategies for HMLV Automation

### Design for Quick Changeover

The key to HMLV automation success is minimizing changeover time and cost.

**Modular Fixturing**
- Master pallets with interchangeable nests
- Quick-change tooling systems
- Self-locating fixture plates
- RFID identification of fixtures

**Software-Based Changeover**
- Recipe-driven programs for different products
- Automatic parameter adjustment
- Vision-guided operations that adapt to part variation
- Barcode or RFID-initiated changeover

**Mechanical Quick Change**
- Tool-less fixture changes
- Quick-disconnect utilities
- Color-coded components
- Clear setup documentation

### Prioritize Flexibility Over Speed

In HMLV, maximizing flexibility often trumps minimizing cycle time:

- Accept slightly longer cycle times for easier programming
- Choose equipment that handles product variation
- Invest in adaptable tooling rather than optimized single-purpose tools
- Design for future product variations, not just current parts

### Focus on High-Value Operations

Automate operations where automation adds the most value:

- Quality-critical processes requiring consistency
- Operations with documentation requirements
- Hazardous or ergonomically challenging tasks
- Bottleneck operations constraining throughput

Leave simple, quick operations manual when automation doesn't add proportional value.

## Equipment for Flexible Automation

### Collaborative Robots

[Cobots](/blog/what-is-industrial-automation/) are ideal for HMLV environments:

- Easy programming through hand guidance
- Quick redeployment between tasks
- Safe operation alongside workers
- Lower investment than traditional robots

A cobot can be moved between workstations to address different bottlenecks as product mix changes.

### Vision-Guided Robotics

Vision systems enable flexibility by:

- Locating parts without precise fixturing
- Adapting to product variations
- Guiding robots to variable positions
- Reducing fixture complexity and changeover

Properly implemented vision can eliminate fixture changes entirely for some applications.

### Flexible Feeding Systems

Traditional vibratory feeders are designed for specific parts. Flexible alternatives include:

- Vision-guided bin picking
- Flexible bowl feeders with adjustable tooling
- Flex feeders that handle multiple part types
- Gravity-fed systems with adjustable guides

### Modular Assembly Cells

[Robotic cells](/capabilities/robotic-cells/) designed for flexibility:

- Standardized cell platforms that accept different tooling
- Quick-change end-of-arm tooling
- Mobile cells that can be repositioned
- Cells designed for multiple product families

### Adaptive Fixturing

Fixtures that adjust to different products:

- Adjustable locating pins on grid plates
- Vacuum fixturing for sheet products
- Magnetic fixturing for ferrous parts
- Compliant fixturing for dimensional variation

## Programming Strategies

### Offline Programming

Develop robot programs without stopping production:

- Use [simulation software](/services/digital-twins/) to create new programs
- Validate programs virtually before downloading
- Build program libraries for product families
- Reduce development time for new products

### Parameterized Programs

Create master programs with adjustable parameters:

- Position offsets for different part sizes
- Speed adjustments for different materials
- Force settings for different assemblies
- Single program serves multiple products

### Template-Based Development

Reuse proven program structures:

- Standard program templates for common operations
- Copy and modify rather than develop from scratch
- Consistent structure simplifies maintenance
- Faster development for new products

## Calculating HMLV Automation ROI

Traditional ROI models assume stable production. HMLV calculations must account for:

### Changeover Impact

- Time spent on changeovers (currently and post-automation)
- Changeover frequency per day/week
- Labor required for changeovers
- Quality losses during changeover

### Mix Variability

- Range of products to be automated
- Percentage of volume covered by automation
- Products that still require manual processing
- Future product development plans

### Learning Curve

- Time to develop programs for new products
- Training requirements for varied operations
- Maintenance complexity with varied tooling
- Documentation requirements per product

### Flexibility Value

- Faster response to customer demands
- Ability to accept shorter-run orders
- Reduced lead times as competitive advantage
- Capacity for future product variations

The ROI calculation for HMLV often shows longer payback than high-volume automation, but the strategic value of flexibility may justify investment regardless.

## Implementation Approach

### Start Small

Begin with a single cell or operation:

- Prove the concept with limited risk
- Learn what works in your environment
- Build organizational capability
- Scale based on demonstrated success

### Choose the Right Pilot

Select an initial project that:

- Has clear automation benefit
- Represents typical production challenges
- Is visible enough to demonstrate value
- Is not so critical that failure is catastrophic

### Plan for Iteration

Expect to optimize over time:

- Initial implementation proves feasibility
- Production experience reveals improvements
- New products require program development
- Continuous improvement drives efficiency

### Build Internal Capability

HMLV automation requires ongoing programming:

- Train operators on basic robot operation
- Develop internal programming skills
- Establish relationships with automation partners
- Build a library of solutions

## Case Example

A contract manufacturer producing precision assemblies for medical and aerospace customers faced challenges:

- 200+ different assemblies
- Typical lot sizes of 50-500 pieces
- Strict quality documentation requirements
- Growing business with labor constraints

Solution implemented:

- Three flexible robotic assembly cells
- Vision-guided part handling
- Quick-change fixture systems
- Barcode-initiated recipe selection

Results:

- 60% labor reduction in automated operations
- Changeover time under 10 minutes
- Complete documentation automatically generated
- Capacity for 30% more volume
