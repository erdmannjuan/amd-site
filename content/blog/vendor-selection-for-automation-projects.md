## Why Vendor Selection Can Make or Break Your Automation Project

Choosing the wrong automation vendor is one of the most expensive mistakes a manufacturer can make. We've seen companies lose hundreds of thousands of dollars—not because the technology was wrong, but because the integrator couldn't deliver what they promised. The machine shows up late, doesn't hit cycle time, struggles with your part geometry, and suddenly you're months behind schedule with a line that won't run.

The flip side is equally true. The right vendor relationship becomes a long-term competitive advantage. When your integrator understands your processes, your tolerances, and your production constraints, subsequent projects go faster, cost less, and perform better out of the gate.

This guide walks through a structured approach to vendor evaluation that we've refined over 30 years and more than 2,500 delivered systems. Whether you're sourcing your first automated cell or expanding an existing line, these principles apply.

## Start With a Clear Scope of Work

Before you contact a single vendor, document exactly what you need the system to do. This sounds obvious, but incomplete specifications are the root cause of most vendor disputes. Your scope should include:

- **Part specifications**: drawings, tolerances, materials, and any variations or part families the system must handle
- **Cycle time requirements**: target throughput, including any allowances for changeover between variants
- **Process requirements**: specific operations the system must perform (pressing, fastening, testing, dispensing, etc.)
- **Quality standards**: inspection criteria, SPC requirements, traceability, and reject handling
- **Integration points**: how the cell connects to upstream and downstream processes, MES/ERP interfaces, and data logging requirements
- **Floor space and utility constraints**: available footprint, ceiling height, power, air, and any environmental factors

A well-written specification does two things: it forces you to think through requirements you might otherwise overlook, and it gives vendors a common baseline for quoting. When every vendor is pricing against the same spec, you can make apples-to-apples comparisons instead of guessing why one quote is half the price of another.

## Evaluating Technical Capability

Price is easy to compare. Technical capability is harder—and far more important. Here's what to look for during the evaluation phase.

### Relevant Experience

Ask for case studies or references from projects similar to yours. A vendor who has built fifty palletizing cells may not be the right choice for a precision [assembly system](/solutions/automated-assembly-systems/) requiring micron-level accuracy. Relevant experience means they've solved problems like yours before and know where the pitfalls are.

### Engineering Depth

Dig into how the vendor approaches design. Do they have mechanical, electrical, and controls engineers on staff, or do they subcontract critical disciplines? In-house engineering teams tend to produce more cohesive designs because the mechanical engineer and the controls engineer are sitting ten feet apart, not in different zip codes.

Ask about their simulation and validation tools. Vendors who use 3D modeling, FEA, and cycle time simulation before cutting metal are far less likely to deliver a machine that doesn't hit spec.

### Build Quality

If possible, visit the vendor's facility. Walk the shop floor. Look at machines in build. Pay attention to cable management, panel wiring, guarding quality, and documentation standards. These details tell you more about a vendor's standards than any sales presentation.

## The RFQ and Proposal Process

Structure your RFQ to get useful information back, not just a number. Include your full scope of work and ask vendors to respond with:

- A concept description or preliminary layout
- A line-item breakdown of major components (robots, tooling, controls, safety, vision, etc.)
- Preliminary cycle time analysis
- Project timeline from order to FAT (Factory Acceptance Test)
- Warranty terms and support structure
- References from comparable projects

When proposals come back, score them against weighted criteria. A simple matrix works well:

| Criteria | Weight | Vendor A | Vendor B | Vendor C |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Technical approach | 30% | | | |
| Relevant experience | 25% | | | |
| Price | 20% | | | |
| Timeline | 15% | | | |
| Support/warranty | 10% | | | |

Notice that price is only 20% of the total. That's deliberate. The cheapest machine that doesn't hit cycle time or requires constant maintenance is the most expensive machine you'll ever buy.

## Red Flags to Watch For

Over three decades of building and delivering automation, we've learned to spot warning signs early:

- **Vague proposals**: If a vendor can't explain how they'll achieve your cycle time, they probably haven't figured it out yet.
- **No questions asked**: A vendor who reads your spec and comes back with zero clarifying questions either didn't read it carefully or is planning to figure it out later.
- **Unrealistic timelines**: Complex automation systems take time to design, build, and debug. A vendor promising delivery in half the time of competitors is likely cutting corners on validation.
- **Resistance to FAT**: Any reputable integrator should welcome a thorough Factory Acceptance Test. If they push back, ask why.
- **High staff turnover**: The project manager who sold you the job should still be involved when it ships. Ask about team continuity.

## Contract and Commercial Considerations

A solid contract protects both parties. Key elements to address include:

- **Acceptance criteria**: Define exactly what the machine must demonstrate during FAT and SAT (Site Acceptance Test) to be considered accepted. Tie these to measurable performance metrics—cycle time, uptime percentage, Cpk values.
- **Payment milestones**: Structure payments around deliverables, not calendar dates. A typical structure might be 30% at order, 20% at design approval, 30% at FAT, and 20% at SAT.
- **Change order process**: Changes will happen. Define how they're documented, priced, and approved before they become disputes.
- **Warranty and support**: Clarify what's covered, for how long, and what response times you can expect. Ask about remote diagnostics capability and spare parts availability.

If you're working through [calculating ROI for your automation project](/blog/calculating-roi-for-industrial-automation-projects/), remember that vendor-related risks—delays, rework, underperformance—directly impact your payback timeline. Building contingency into your financial model for these risks is prudent engineering.

## Building a Long-Term Partnership

The best vendor relationships extend beyond a single project. When you find an integrator who delivers consistently, keep them close. They'll accumulate knowledge about your processes, your standards, and your team's preferences that makes every subsequent project more efficient.

Share feedback openly—what worked, what didn't, what you'd change next time. Vendors who are receptive to constructive criticism and who proactively suggest improvements are the ones worth keeping.

Invest in a proper [preventive maintenance program](/blog/preventive-maintenance-programs-for-automation/) for the equipment they deliver. Nothing strains a vendor relationship faster than a support call about a failure that could have been prevented with basic upkeep.

## Getting It Right the First Time

Vendor selection isn't glamorous, but it's one of the highest-leverage decisions in any automation project. Spend the time upfront to define your requirements clearly, evaluate candidates rigorously, and structure contracts that align incentives. The payoff is a system that runs the way it should, delivered by a team you can count on for the next project.

AMD Machines has been on both sides of this process—as a vendor competing for projects and as an engineering team helping customers evaluate options.
