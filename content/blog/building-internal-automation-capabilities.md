## Why Internal Automation Capabilities Matter

Every manufacturer that invests in automation faces a fundamental question: how much expertise should live inside your organization versus being sourced externally? The answer, in most cases, is that you need a meaningful amount of both. But the internal side—having people on your floor who truly understand your automated systems—is what separates companies that get sustained value from their equipment and those that watch ROI erode over time.

When a servo drive faults at 2 AM on a Thursday and you're running a critical production order, the difference between a 20-minute fix and an 8-hour wait for a service call is enormous. That difference comes down to whether you've built internal capabilities or left yourself entirely dependent on outside support.

This isn't about replacing your integration partners or equipment vendors. It's about building the institutional knowledge that lets you maintain uptime, troubleshoot effectively, and continuously improve your automated processes without a phone call for every issue.

## Assessing Where You Stand Today

Before building anything, you need an honest assessment of your current capabilities. Walk your floor and ask some pointed questions:

- **Who actually understands the automation equipment?** Not who was trained two years ago—who can troubleshoot it today?
- **What happens when your most knowledgeable person is out?** If one technician holds all the tribal knowledge, you have a single point of failure.
- **How long do typical fault recoveries take?** Track this data. It tells you where capability gaps are costing you production time.
- **What percentage of maintenance is reactive versus planned?** Heavy reactive maintenance usually indicates a skills or knowledge gap.

Document these answers honestly. The gap between where you are and where you need to be defines your roadmap. Many manufacturers discover that they've been operating with far less internal capability than they assumed, particularly if they went through a period of turnover in their maintenance department.

## Building the Right Team

The foundation of internal automation capability is people. You need technicians who can work across mechanical, electrical, and controls disciplines—and finding them isn't easy given the current [skills gap in manufacturing automation](/blog/the-skills-gap-in-manufacturing-automation/).

### Hiring Strategy

Look beyond the traditional maintenance technician profile. The ideal automation technician combines mechanical aptitude with electrical troubleshooting skills and at least a working understanding of PLC logic. Community college mechatronics programs are producing graduates with this cross-disciplinary foundation, though they'll still need plant-specific training.

Consider hiring for aptitude over experience when you can't find the perfect candidate. Someone with strong electrical skills and genuine curiosity about controls can be trained on PLCs. Someone with PLC experience who's willing to get their hands dirty with mechanical work can grow into a full automation technician. Rigid job descriptions that require expertise across every discipline will leave positions unfilled for months.

### Training Programs

Structured training is non-negotiable. Ad hoc, learn-as-you-go approaches create inconsistent knowledge and leave critical gaps. A solid [training program for automation technicians](/blog/training-programs-for-automation-technicians/) should include several components:

**Vendor-specific training.** Most major PLC, robot, and drive manufacturers offer training courses. Send your people. The cost of a week-long course is trivial compared to a single extended downtime event caused by a technician who doesn't understand the equipment.

**Internal knowledge transfer.** Pair less experienced technicians with your senior people during troubleshooting events. These real-world situations are where the deepest learning happens. Document what was found, what was tried, and what worked. Build a library of fault histories specific to your equipment.

**Cross-training across systems.** Don't let technicians specialize so narrowly that they only know one machine or one brand. Rotate assignments so that multiple people can work on every critical system. This eliminates the single-point-of-failure problem that plagues many maintenance departments.

**Simulation and offline practice.** Modern PLC programming environments let technicians work with logic offline. Set up training stations where people can practice without risking production equipment. This is especially valuable for teaching fault diagnosis—you can introduce faults in a controlled environment and let technicians work through the diagnostic process.

## Developing Maintenance and Support Infrastructure

Capable people need the right infrastructure to be effective. This means documentation, spare parts, and systematic maintenance programs.

### Documentation That Actually Gets Used

Most plants have documentation sitting in binders that nobody opens. Effective documentation is accessible, organized, and relevant. For each automated system, maintain:

- **Electrical schematics** that reflect the as-built condition, not just the original design
- **PLC program backups** with version control so you can identify when changes were made
- **Fault code references** with your own annotations about what each code actually means on your specific machine
- **Calibration procedures** with clear steps, expected values, and acceptable tolerances
- **Spare parts lists** organized by system, with vendor part numbers and internal stock numbers

Put this information where technicians can access it at the machine—tablets, workstations on the floor, or printed quick-reference guides mounted on electrical panels. Documentation that requires a trip to the engineering office doesn't get used during urgent troubleshooting.

### Spare Parts Management

Nothing defeats internal capability faster than having the knowledge to fix a problem but not the parts. Identify critical spares for every automated system—the components whose failure stops production—and keep them in stock. This includes servo drives, I/O modules, sensors, contactors, and any custom or long-lead-time components.

Track spare parts usage to identify patterns. If you're replacing the same proximity sensor every three months, that's not a spare parts problem—it's an application problem that needs engineering attention.

### Preventive Maintenance Programs

Shift from reactive to [preventive maintenance](/blog/preventive-maintenance-programs-for-automation/) as quickly as possible. A structured PM program catches problems before they cause unplanned downtime. It also gives technicians regular, scheduled interaction with every system, which builds familiarity and confidence.

Start with manufacturer-recommended maintenance intervals, then adjust based on your actual operating conditions. A robot running 20 hours a day in a dusty environment needs more frequent attention than one running 8 hours in a clean room. Track PM completion rates and correlate them with unplanned downtime events to demonstrate the value of the program.

## Scaling Knowledge Across the Organization

Internal capabilities shouldn't live only in the maintenance department. Operators who understand the basics of their automated equipment—how to clear common faults, when to call for help versus attempting a restart, what abnormal operation looks and sounds like—dramatically reduce downtime.

Develop tiered response protocols. Level 1 responses (operator-level) might include clearing fault codes, verifying material feeds, and performing basic resets. Level 2 (maintenance technician) handles electrical and mechanical troubleshooting, component replacement, and program modifications. Level 3 (engineering or external support) addresses design changes, major rebuilds, and problems that exceed internal expertise.

This structure lets you handle the majority of issues quickly while reserving expensive external support for situations that genuinely require it.

## Measuring Progress

Track metrics that reflect your actual capability improvement:

- **Mean time to repair (MTTR)** for automation-related downtime events
- **Percentage of issues resolved internally** versus requiring outside support
- **Unplanned downtime hours** per system per month
- **PM completion rate** as a percentage of scheduled tasks
- **Training hours completed** per technician per quarter

Review these monthly and look for trends. Capability building is gradual—don't expect dramatic improvement in the first quarter. But if MTTR isn't declining and internal resolution rates aren't climbing after six months, something in your approach needs adjustment.

## Getting Started

Building internal automation capabilities is a long-term investment, not a project with a defined end date. Start with your most critical systems—the ones where downtime costs the most—and expand from there. Prioritize getting the right people in place, then build the infrastructure and programs around them.

The manufacturers who sustain the highest returns from automation are invariably the ones who invested in their own people and processes, not just their equipment.
