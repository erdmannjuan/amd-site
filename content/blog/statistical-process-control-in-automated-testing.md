## Understanding Automated Testing

Apply SPC methods to test data for process monitoring and continuous improvement.

Quality assurance through automated testing and inspection has become essential for manufacturers facing demanding specifications and cost pressures. Automated systems provide the consistency and data capture that manual inspection cannot match.

## Test Strategy Development

Develop a comprehensive test strategy by:

- **Identifying critical parameters** that affect product function and safety
- **Determining test methods** appropriate for each parameter
- **Setting pass/fail limits** based on specifications and process capability
- **Establishing sampling rates** balancing coverage and throughput
- **Planning data collection** for traceability and analysis

## Test Technologies

Common automated test methods include:

1. **Electrical testing** - continuity, isolation, and functional tests
2. **Leak testing** - pressure decay, mass flow, and tracer gas methods
3. **Dimensional inspection** - contact and non-contact measurement
4. **Visual inspection** - camera-based defect detection
5. **Functional testing** - verifying product operation

## System Architecture

Automated test systems typically include:

- **Test fixtures** that interface with products under test
- **Instrumentation** for measurement and stimulus generation
- **Control systems** that sequence tests and collect data
- **Material handling** to load, position, and unload products
- **Data management** for storage, analysis, and reporting

## Continuous Improvement

Leverage test data for ongoing improvement:

- Monitor test yields and failure modes over time
- Correlate test results with process parameters
- Adjust test limits based on process capability
- Feed back quality data to upstream processes
- Use statistical methods to identify trends and issues
