## About Calculating ROI for Industrial Automation Projects

Build a business case for automation with realistic cost and benefit analysis.

## Key Concepts

Here's what you need to know:

- **Know your process** - document what you're doing now and what needs to change
- **Pick the right tech** - match equipment to your actual requirements
- **Plan the rollout** - budget time for debugging and training
- **Track results** - measure before and after
- **Keep improving** - automation is never 'done'

## Benefits and Considerations

The tradeoffs:

**Benefits:**
- Faster cycle times and less rework
- Fewer defects, tighter tolerances
- Real-time dashboards showing actual vs. target
