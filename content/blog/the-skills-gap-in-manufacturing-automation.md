## The Manufacturing Automation Skills Gap Is Real—and Growing

Walk into almost any manufacturing facility running automated equipment, and you'll hear some version of the same concern: "We can't find enough people who know how to run this stuff." It's not a new complaint, but the problem is accelerating. As automation technology advances and experienced technicians retire, the gap between available talent and required skills keeps widening.

This isn't an abstract workforce policy issue. It's an operational problem that directly affects uptime, throughput, and the ability to justify new automation investments. A $2 million robotic assembly cell doesn't deliver ROI if the maintenance team can't troubleshoot a servo fault or modify a PLC program when product requirements change.

## Where the Gap Hits Hardest

The skills shortage in manufacturing automation isn't uniform. Some areas are more affected than others, and understanding where the pain points are helps prioritize training investments.

### PLC and Controls Programming

Programmable logic controllers remain the backbone of industrial automation. Every conveyor, press, robot cell, and inspection station runs on control logic that someone has to write, debug, and maintain. The demand for technicians who can work with Allen-Bradley, Siemens, or Mitsubishi platforms far outpaces supply. Experienced controls engineers who can architect entire systems from scratch are even harder to find.

The challenge is compounded by the shift toward more sophisticated control architectures. Modern automation systems integrate safety PLCs, motion controllers, HMI applications, and industrial networking—all requiring different but overlapping skill sets. A technician who learned ladder logic on a SLC-500 twenty years ago may struggle with structured text programming on a CompactLogix platform without additional training.

### Robotics Integration and Programming

Industrial robots have become standard equipment in manufacturing, but finding technicians who can program and maintain them remains difficult. Each robot manufacturer—FANUC, ABB, KUKA, Yaskawa—uses its own programming language and teach pendant interface. A technician proficient with FANUC's TP programming still needs significant ramp-up time to work on an ABB system.

Beyond basic programming, the real shortage is in integration skills. Getting a robot to pick up a part is straightforward. Getting it to work reliably within a larger [automated assembly system](/solutions/automated-assembly-systems/) that includes vision inspection, force sensing, and coordinated motion with other equipment requires deeper expertise.

### Vision Systems and Inspection

Machine vision has moved from a specialty technology to a standard component in quality-critical manufacturing. Camera-based inspection, barcode reading, and dimensional measurement are now expected capabilities on most production lines. But configuring vision systems—setting lighting, selecting optics, writing inspection algorithms, and establishing pass/fail criteria—requires a specific skill set that few technicians possess coming out of school.

### Data and Network Infrastructure

As factories adopt Industry 4.0 concepts, the line between IT and OT (operational technology) keeps blurring. Automation technicians increasingly need to understand industrial networking protocols like EtherNet/IP and PROFINET, manage network switches and firewalls, and work with databases and SCADA systems. This intersection of manufacturing knowledge and information technology skills is particularly hard to staff.

## Why Traditional Hiring Alone Won't Solve It

Many manufacturers respond to the skills gap by trying to hire their way out of the problem. That approach has limits. The pool of experienced automation professionals is finite, and competing for them with higher salaries just redistributes the shortage without addressing it.

The demographics make the math worse. According to industry surveys, a significant percentage of the current automation workforce is within ten years of retirement. These are the people who built and maintained the systems that many plants rely on today. When they leave, they take decades of institutional knowledge with them—knowledge that isn't captured in manuals or maintenance logs.

Community colleges and technical schools produce graduates with foundational skills, but most employers report that new hires still need one to three years of on-the-job training before they can work independently on complex automation equipment. That's a significant investment, and it only pays off if the employee stays.

## Practical Strategies That Work

There's no single solution to the automation skills gap, but manufacturers who approach it systematically tend to fare better than those who react crisis by crisis.

### Build Internal Training Programs

The most effective approach is developing your own people. Structured [training programs for automation technicians](/blog/training-programs-for-automation-technicians/) that combine classroom instruction with hands-on equipment time produce better results than relying solely on vendor training courses. Pair newer technicians with experienced ones for mentorship. Document tribal knowledge before it walks out the door.

Create a skills matrix that maps each technician's capabilities against the equipment they need to support. This makes gaps visible and helps prioritize training investments. A technician who can troubleshoot mechanical issues but not electrical faults needs different development than one who can program PLCs but hasn't worked with robotics.

### Partner With Educational Institutions

Building relationships with local community colleges and technical schools creates a pipeline of candidates with relevant foundational skills. Some manufacturers donate equipment, host student tours, or offer internships and apprenticeships. These programs require time to establish, but they produce candidates who arrive with realistic expectations about the work and some baseline competency.

The most successful partnerships involve manufacturers providing input on curriculum development. If your facility runs FANUC robots and Allen-Bradley PLCs, working with the local school to include those specific platforms in their automation program produces graduates who can contribute faster.

### Design Automation Systems for Maintainability

This is an area where equipment design decisions directly affect workforce requirements. Automation systems built with clear documentation, standardized components, and intuitive HMI interfaces are easier for less experienced technicians to maintain. Well-designed [preventive maintenance programs](/blog/preventive-maintenance-programs-for-automation/) with clear procedures and checklists reduce the skill level required for routine upkeep.

When specifying new automation equipment, consider the skill level of the people who will maintain it. A system that requires a controls engineer with fifteen years of experience to troubleshoot is a liability. A system with good diagnostics, clear alarm messages, and modular architecture that allows component-level replacement is a strategic asset.

### Leverage Technology to Reduce Skill Requirements

Remote diagnostics, augmented reality maintenance guides, and predictive analytics tools can all help bridge skill gaps. When an experienced engineer can remotely access a system to diagnose a problem and guide an on-site technician through the repair, you effectively multiply the impact of your most skilled people.

Simulation tools and digital twins also play a role. New programmers can develop and test control logic in a virtual environment before deploying it to production equipment, reducing the risk of learning on live systems.

## The Automation Partner Factor

Choosing the right automation partner matters more than many manufacturers realize when it comes to the skills gap. A machine builder who delivers equipment with poor documentation, proprietary controls architectures, and no training support creates an ongoing staffing headache. A partner who provides comprehensive operator and maintenance training, clear technical documentation, and responsive service support makes the skills gap more manageable.

At AMD Machines, we've seen this dynamic play out across hundreds of projects over three decades. The systems we build are designed with the end user's maintenance team in mind—standardized platforms, thorough documentation, and training that covers both routine operation and troubleshooting. When your team can confidently maintain and optimize their equipment, automation delivers the returns it's supposed to.

## Moving Forward

The skills gap in manufacturing automation isn't going to close on its own. It requires deliberate investment in people, processes, and partnerships. Manufacturers who treat workforce development as a strategic priority—not just an HR function—position themselves to get more value from their automation investments and adapt faster as technology continues to evolve.
