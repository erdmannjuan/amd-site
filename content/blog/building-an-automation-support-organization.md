## The Gap Between Installation and Long-Term Performance

Getting automation equipment installed and running is a milestone worth celebrating. But in our experience building over 2,500 custom machines, we have seen a clear pattern: the manufacturers who extract the most value from their automation investments are not necessarily the ones who buy the most advanced equipment. They are the ones who build capable internal support organizations around that equipment.

The distinction matters because automation systems are not static. Tooling wears. Sensors drift. Process conditions shift with material lot variations. Software requires updates as products evolve. Without a dedicated team managing these realities, even well-designed equipment degrades in performance over time. Uptime drops from the 95%+ target into the low 80s. Quality escapes increase. Cycle times creep upward as operators apply band-aid fixes that accumulate into significant inefficiency.

We have watched plants go through this cycle, and we have also watched plants avoid it entirely by investing in the organizational structure that keeps equipment performing at its design intent. Here is how they do it.

## Defining the Core Roles

An effective automation support organization requires people with distinct but overlapping skill sets. The specific team size depends on your equipment count and shift schedule, but the roles themselves are consistent across operations of all sizes.

**Automation Technicians** are the front line. These individuals respond to equipment faults, perform scheduled maintenance tasks, and handle first-level troubleshooting. A capable automation technician reads ladder logic, interprets fault code histories, traces wiring, and understands mechanical assemblies well enough to identify worn components before they cause a failure. In most plants, you need one technician for every five to eight automated cells on a given shift.

**Controls Engineers** handle the problems that exceed technician-level troubleshooting. This includes PLC program modifications, servo tuning, robot path optimization, HMI development, and network diagnostics. Controls engineers also lead process improvements — reducing cycle time, adding new product variants, or integrating equipment with plant-level MES and SCADA systems. Most operations running 10 to 25 automated cells need one or two controls engineers.

**Mechanical and Electrical Specialists** address discipline-specific maintenance. Mechanical specialists manage gearbox rebuilds, linear guide replacements, pneumatic system overhauls, and precision alignment tasks. Electrical specialists handle panel maintenance, drive replacements, cable management, and power quality issues. In smaller operations these responsibilities fold into the technician role, but as your automation footprint grows beyond 15 cells, dedicated specialists pay for themselves through faster repair times and fewer repeat failures.

**A Support Coordinator** ties the organization together. This role owns the maintenance schedule, manages spare parts inventory, tracks performance metrics, coordinates with production scheduling for planned downtime windows, and serves as the primary liaison between the support team and plant management. Without this coordination function, even skilled technicians operate in silos and critical tasks fall through the cracks.

## Developing and Retaining Technical Skills

Hiring good people is the starting point, but keeping their skills current is an ongoing requirement. Automation technology evolves continuously. The technician who was proficient on a specific robot platform five years ago may have limited experience with the vision systems, collaborative robots, or edge computing devices being deployed today.

Structured [training programs for automation technicians](/blog/training-programs-for-automation-technicians/) should operate on multiple levels. Equipment-specific training from the OEM during installation and commissioning gives your team familiarity with the exact hardware and software they will maintain daily. Vendor certification programs build deeper expertise on specific platforms. Cross-training within the team ensures that knowledge of any single system is never held by only one person.

One of the most effective development methods we have observed is structured mentorship during live troubleshooting. Pair a junior technician with an experienced one during a real equipment fault. The senior technician narrates their diagnostic process — why they checked that particular sensor first, what the fault history pattern suggests, how they narrowed the root cause from a system-level symptom to a specific component. This hands-on approach builds diagnostic intuition that no classroom curriculum can replicate.

Equally important is capturing tribal knowledge in written form. When a senior technician discovers that a specific robot axis develops backlash after 18 months, or that a particular sensor requires threshold adjustment with seasonal ambient light changes, that information belongs in a shared maintenance database. Knowledge that exists only in someone's head leaves with them when they retire or change roles.

## Preventive Maintenance as the Backbone

Reactive maintenance — waiting for equipment to break before addressing it — is the most expensive strategy available. Every hour of unplanned downtime carries direct production loss costs plus indirect costs in expedited parts, overtime labor, missed customer deliveries, and the cascade effects of disrupted scheduling.

A disciplined [preventive maintenance program](/blog/preventive-maintenance-programs-for-automation/) catches wear and degradation before they cause failures. The fundamentals include regular inspections, lubrication schedules, filter changes, belt tension verification, and calibration checks. For robotic systems, add cable dress-out inspection, TCP accuracy verification, tool changer maintenance, and servo motor temperature trending.

Organize PM tasks into daily, weekly, monthly, and annual tiers. Daily checks are quick visual inspections and basic verifications that operators perform at shift start. Weekly and monthly tasks require technician skills and short planned downtime windows. Annual tasks are comprehensive overhauls aligned with plant shutdown schedules.

The key discipline is tracking PM completion rates and correlating them against unplanned downtime data. If a cell experiences repeated failures despite adherence to the PM schedule, the schedule itself needs revision. Either the intervals are too long, or the task list misses a critical inspection point. Continuous refinement of PM schedules based on actual equipment behavior is what separates adequate maintenance programs from excellent ones.

## Spare Parts Management

A technician who correctly diagnoses a failure but cannot get the replacement part for eight weeks has not actually solved the problem. Spare parts management is a critical function that directly impacts mean time to repair.

Categorize components by criticality and lead time. Servo drives, specialty sensors, custom-machined tooling components, and other items with long procurement lead times and high impact on equipment availability belong in your on-site inventory. Standard components available from local distributors within 24 hours can be ordered as needed. Everything between these extremes requires judgment based on your risk tolerance and budget.

Work with your equipment integrator during the [commissioning phase](/blog/commissioning-and-startup-best-practices/) to obtain recommended spare parts lists. An experienced integrator identifies the components most likely to need replacement over a five-year horizon and specifies exact part numbers, quantities, and reorder points. This information is vastly more useful during initial startup than when you are scrambling to identify an obsolete part number during a production-critical breakdown.

## Tracking Performance With Meaningful Metrics

A support organization without metrics operates on intuition rather than data. At minimum, track four key indicators:

- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** combines availability, performance, and quality into a single percentage representing how well equipment is utilized relative to its theoretical maximum.
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** measures how long equipment runs between unplanned stops. An increasing trend confirms that preventive efforts are working.
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)** measures how quickly equipment returns to production after a failure. This metric reflects technician skill, spare parts availability, diagnostic documentation quality, and organizational response processes.
- **PM Completion Rate** tracks the percentage of scheduled preventive maintenance tasks completed on time. Consistent rates below 90% indicate resource or scheduling constraints that need management attention.

Review these metrics monthly with both the support team and production leadership. Focus on trends rather than individual data points. A single bad week may reflect an unusual event, but a declining three-month trend demands root cause investigation and corrective action.

## Scaling Support Alongside Your Automation Roadmap

One of the most common mistakes we see manufacturers make is adding automated equipment without proportionally growing their support capability. The result is predictable: technicians spread too thin, preventive maintenance schedules slip, and unplanned downtime increases — exactly the outcomes the support organization was built to prevent.

Plan support organization growth in parallel with your automation roadmap. If three new robotic cells are coming online next year, budget for the additional technician headcount and training required to support them. Factor in the ramp-up period where new equipment typically demands extra attention as infant mortality issues surface and get resolved.

## Getting Started

If your plant lacks a formal automation support organization today, start with the fundamentals. Assign clear ownership for equipment maintenance. Establish a preventive maintenance schedule for your highest-value equipment. Begin logging downtime events with root cause analysis. Build a spare parts inventory for critical components with long lead times.

These foundational steps create the organizational structure that grows with your automation footprint and protects the return on every machine you install.
