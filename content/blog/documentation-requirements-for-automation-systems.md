## About Documentation Requirements for Automation Systems

Create and maintain documentation that supports operation and maintenance.

## Key Concepts

Here's what you need to know:

- **Know your process** - document what you're doing now and what needs to change
- **Pick the right tech** - match equipment to your actual requirements
- **Plan the rollout** - budget time for debugging and training
- **Track results** - measure before and after
- **Keep improving** - automation is never 'done'

## Benefits and Considerations

The tradeoffs:

**Benefits:**
- Faster cycle times and less rework
- Fewer defects, tighter tolerances
- Real-time dashboards showing actual vs. target
- Lower cost-per-part after payback

**Considerations:**
- Initial investment requirements
- Implementation complexity
- Training and change management
- Ongoing maintenance needs

## Best Practices

What works:

1. Start with clear objectives tied to business goals
2. Involve stakeholders from multiple functions early
3. Plan for adequate testing and validation
4. Invest in training for operators and maintainers
5. Establish metrics and monitor progress

## Getting Started
