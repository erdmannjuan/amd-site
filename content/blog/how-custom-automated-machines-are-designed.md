Custom automated machinery represents significant engineering investment, but the process of designing and building these systems can seem mysterious to those outside the automation industry. Understanding how custom machines are developed helps set realistic expectations and ensures successful project outcomes.

## Phase 1: Discovery and Requirements Definition

Every custom automation project begins with thorough requirements gathering. This phase establishes the foundation for all subsequent engineering work.

### Understanding the Application

The automation integrator's team works to understand:

- **The product** being manufactured—geometry, materials, tolerances, weight
- **Current process** if one exists—how the operation is performed today
- **Pain points** driving the automation need—labor, quality, capacity, safety
- **Integration requirements** with upstream and downstream equipment
- **Facility constraints** including available space, utilities, and environment

### Defining Success Criteria

Clear project objectives must be established:

- **Throughput targets**—parts per hour, shift, or year
- **Quality requirements**—acceptable defect rates, measurement tolerances
- **Flexibility needs**—how many product variants, changeover time requirements
- **Budget parameters**—investment range and ROI expectations
- **Timeline**—when production must begin

### Feasibility Assessment

Before committing to full development, experienced integrators assess:

- Technical feasibility—can the process be automated reliably?
- Economic feasibility—does the ROI justify the investment?
- Risk factors—what could prevent success?

This may include concept studies, proof-of-concept testing, or [simulation modeling](/services/digital-twins/) for complex applications.

## Phase 2: Concept Development

With requirements defined, engineering begins developing the automation concept.

### Process Development

For new processes, engineers determine:

- How the manufacturing operation will be performed
- What technologies will accomplish each task
- The sequence of operations
- Cycle time estimates for each step

Process development may require testing with customer parts to validate assumptions.

### Mechanical Concepts

Mechanical engineers develop preliminary layouts showing:

- Overall machine footprint and arrangement
- Major component placement (robots, presses, conveyors)
- Operator stations and access points
- Material flow through the system
- Safety guarding approach

Multiple concepts may be explored before selecting the optimal approach.

### Controls Architecture

Controls engineers define:

- PLC platform selection
- Robot controller requirements
- Vision system specifications
- HMI approach and operator interface
- Network architecture and connectivity
- Safety system requirements

### Technology Selection

Key component decisions are made:

- Robot make, model, and payload
- Servo systems and drives
- Sensors and measurement devices
- Tooling and fixture concepts
- Material handling mechanisms

### Concept Review

The concept package is reviewed with the customer, including:

- Layout drawings and 3D models
- Process flow descriptions
- Cycle time analysis
- Preliminary cost estimate
- Project schedule

Customer approval of the concept enables detailed engineering.

## Phase 3: Detailed Engineering

Detailed engineering transforms concepts into buildable designs.

### Mechanical Design

Mechanical engineers create complete designs for:

- **Custom fixtures** that hold and position parts precisely
- **End-of-arm tooling** for robots—grippers, welding torches, vision mounts
- **Structural elements**—machine bases, frames, guarding
- **Material handling**—conveyors, lifts, transfer mechanisms
- **Utility systems**—pneumatics, lubrication, chip management

Modern automation uses 3D CAD software to model every component. Interference checking ensures parts fit together correctly.

### Electrical Design

Electrical engineers develop:

- **Electrical schematics** showing all power and control wiring
- **Panel layouts** for control enclosures
- **Pneumatic schematics** for air-powered devices
- **Cable routing** and wire harness designs
- **Component specifications** and bill of materials

Designs follow relevant codes and standards including NFPA 79 for industrial machinery.

### Controls Engineering

Controls engineers develop:

- **PLC programs** that sequence and control the machine
- **HMI screens** for operator interface
- **Robot programs** for motion and process execution
- **Vision system configurations** for inspection and guidance
- **Safety PLC programs** for safety-rated functions

[Digital twin technology](/services/digital-twins/) allows much of this development to occur in simulation before hardware exists.

### Design Reviews

Multiple reviews occur throughout detailed engineering:

- Internal design reviews catch errors before release
- Customer reviews ensure the design meets requirements
- Safety reviews verify compliance with standards
- Procurement reviews confirm component availability

## Phase 4: Procurement and Fabrication

With approved designs, physical construction begins.

### Component Procurement

Purchasing agents and engineers source:

- **Major equipment**—robots, drives, PLCs
- **Commercial components**—sensors, pneumatics, motors
- **Fabricated parts**—machined components, sheet metal
- **Electrical materials**—wire, cable, connectors

Lead times for some components can be months, making early ordering critical.

### In-House Fabrication

Many automation integrators have internal fabrication capabilities:

- CNC machining for precision components
- Welding for structural assemblies
- Sheet metal for guarding and enclosures
- Wire harness assembly

### Assembly

Skilled technicians assemble the mechanical systems:

- Installing components on machine bases
- Mounting and aligning fixtures
- Installing robots and servo systems
- Running utilities—electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic

### Panel Build

Electrical panels are built from schematics:

- Mounting components to backplanes
- Wiring power and control circuits
- Labeling and documentation
- Testing before installation

## Phase 5: Integration and Testing

The machine comes to life as mechanical, electrical, and controls systems are integrated.

### Electrical Installation

Field wiring connects:

- Panels to machine devices
- Sensors and actuators to control systems
- Safety devices to safety controllers
- Communication networks

### Controls Integration

Controls engineers:

- Download PLC programs
- Configure servo drives and robots
- Set up vision systems
- Establish HMI communications

### System Debugging

The team works through issues:

- Verify sensor inputs and outputs
- Test each motion and sequence
- Tune servo systems for performance
- Debug program logic

### Process Development

Using actual production parts:

- Validate process parameters
- Optimize cycle times
- Verify quality results
- Fine-tune robot paths

### Factory Acceptance Testing

Before shipment, formal testing verifies:

- All functions operate correctly
- Cycle times meet specifications
- Quality requirements are achieved
- Safety systems function properly

Customers typically witness factory acceptance testing to confirm the machine meets requirements.

## Phase 6: Installation and Commissioning

The machine moves to its production home.

### Site Preparation

The customer prepares the facility:

- Foundation or floor preparation
- Utility connections—power, air, network
- Safety fencing installation if not included
- Material handling connections

### Rigging and Placement

Professional riggers:

- Transport equipment safely
- Position machines precisely
- Level and anchor to floor
- Connect sections of larger systems

### Field Startup

The automation team:

- Reconnects after transport
- Verifies all systems function
- Runs through test sequences
- Validates performance

### Production Ramp-Up

Gradual transition to production:

- Initial supervised production runs
- Operator training on machine operation
- Maintenance training on service procedures
- Process optimization for actual conditions

### Site Acceptance

Formal acceptance confirms:

- Performance meets specifications
- Documentation is complete
- Training is delivered
- Warranty period begins

## Phase 7: Support and Optimization

The relationship continues after commissioning.

### Warranty Support

The integrator provides:

- Technical support for issues
- Warranty repairs or replacements
- Remote diagnostics when possible

### Ongoing Service

Long-term support includes:

- [Preventive maintenance](/services/spare-parts/) programs
- Spare parts supply
- Software updates
- Performance optimization

### Future Modifications
