Modern manufacturing relies on a variety of specialized automation equipment. Understanding what each component does and when to apply it helps make informed decisions about automation investments. This guide covers the major categories of industrial automation equipment.

## Industrial Robots

Industrial robots are programmable machines that manipulate parts and tools to perform manufacturing tasks. They're the most visible element of many automation systems.

### Articulated Robots

Six-axis articulated robots resemble a human arm with rotational joints. They offer:

- Maximum flexibility and reach
- Ability to access parts from multiple angles
- Complex path capabilities
- Typical payloads from 5 to 500+ kg

Articulated robots dominate [welding](/solutions/welding/), material handling, and assembly applications. Leading manufacturers include FANUC, ABB, KUKA, and Yaskawa.

### SCARA Robots

Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arms (SCARA) have horizontal arm motions ideal for:

- Pick-and-place operations
- Assembly tasks
- Packaging applications
- High-speed, moderate-payload work

SCARA robots excel when speed is critical and vertical motion is limited.

### Delta Robots

Delta or parallel robots use three arms connected to a common platform. Benefits include:

- Extremely high speeds (150+ picks per minute)
- Excellent for light payloads (typically under 5 kg)
- Perfect for food, pharmaceutical, and electronics packaging
- Overhead mounting maximizes floor space

### Collaborative Robots

Cobots are designed for safe operation near humans without traditional guarding:

- Power and force limiting prevents injury
- Easy programming through teach pendants or hand guidance
- Lower initial cost than traditional robots
- Ideal for human-robot collaboration tasks

Cobots suit applications where complete automation isn't practical or cost-effective.

### Cartesian Robots

Also called gantry or linear robots, these use linear axes:

- XY or XYZ configurations
- Large work envelopes possible
- Simpler programming than articulated robots
- Cost-effective for many applications

Cartesian systems excel in large-area material handling and palletizing.
