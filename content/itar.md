## Current ITAR Compliance Status

**AMD Automation is currently NOT compliant with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).**

Our manufacturing operations are conducted outside of the United States, which means we cannot currently accept projects involving:

- Defense articles listed on the United States Munitions List (USML)
- ITAR-controlled technical data
- Defense services as defined under ITAR
- Projects requiring U.S. person access restrictions
- Any work subject to export control regulations under 22 CFR Parts 120-130

## What is ITAR?

The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is a set of United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List (USML). ITAR requires that access to controlled technical data and defense articles be restricted to U.S. persons unless authorization from the Department of State is received or an exemption applies.

## Our Path Forward

AMD Automation recognizes the importance of serving customers in defense and aerospace industries who require ITAR-compliant automation solutions. We are actively developing plans to establish U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities to service ITAR-regulated industries.

**Current Initiatives:**

- Evaluating locations for U.S.-based manufacturing facilities
- Developing partnerships with ITAR-registered organizations
- Building a domestic engineering and manufacturing team
- Preparing compliance infrastructure and procedures
