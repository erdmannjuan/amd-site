AMD Automation designs and builds turnkey robotic cells tailored to your specific manufacturing requirements. As a **FANUC Authorized System Integrator** with over 25 years of experience, our team handles every aspect from initial concept through installation, training, and ongoing support.

## Custom Robotic Cell Design Process

We start by understanding your production goals, part characteristics, and facility constraints. Our engineers then design a complete robotic automation solution that optimizes cycle time, quality, and operator ergonomics.

Every robotic cell we build undergoes rigorous testing at our facility before shipping. We verify cycle times, quality metrics, and safety systems to ensure your system performs as expected from day one.

## Robot Brands We Integrate

We integrate industrial robots from all major manufacturers, allowing us to select the optimal robot for your application:

- **FANUC** - Industry-leading reliability for welding, material handling, and assembly
- **ABB** - High-speed robots for picking, packing, and palletizing applications
- **KUKA** - Heavy payload robots for automotive and aerospace manufacturing
- **Yaskawa Motoman** - Arc welding specialists with excellent motion control
- **Universal Robots** - Collaborative robots (cobots) for human-robot collaboration
- **Epson** - SCARA and 6-axis robots for precision assembly

## Robotic Cell Components

Our complete robotic cells include all necessary components for production-ready automation:

- **Industrial robots** sized for your payload and reach requirements
- **End-of-arm tooling (EOAT)** custom-designed for your parts
- **Safety systems** including light curtains, area scanners, and safety PLCs
- **Robot positioners** for optimal part presentation
- **Fixturing and workholding** for secure part location
- **Vision systems** for part identification and quality inspection
- **PLC controls** integrated with your existing systems
- **HMI interfaces** for operator interaction and monitoring
