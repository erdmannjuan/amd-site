AMD Automation designs and builds turnkey robotic cells tailored to your specific manufacturing requirements. Our experienced team handles every aspect from initial concept through installation and training.

## Our Approach

We start by understanding your production goals, part characteristics, and facility constraints. Our engineers then design a complete solution that optimizes cycle time, quality, and operator ergonomics.

Every robotic cell we build undergoes rigorous testing at our facility before shipping. We verify cycle times, quality metrics, and safety systems to ensure your system performs as expected from day one.

## Technology Partners

We integrate robots from all major manufacturers including FANUC, ABB, KUKA, Yaskawa, and Universal Robots. This allows us to select the optimal robot for your application rather than being limited to a single brand.

## Turnkey Delivery

Our turnkey approach means you receive a complete, tested system ready for production. This includes:

- Mechanical design and fabrication
- Electrical controls and programming
- Safety systems and compliance
- Installation and commissioning
- Operator and maintenance training
- Ongoing technical support
