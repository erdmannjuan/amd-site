AMD Automation excels at solving manufacturing challenges that don't fit standard automation solutions. When you need something that doesn't exist, we create it.

## Why Custom?

Standard automation products work well for common applications. But manufacturing often presents unique challenges:

- Unusual part geometries or materials
- Proprietary processes that require specialized equipment
- Space or layout constraints
- Integration with existing equipment
- Unique quality or safety requirements
- Production volumes between manual and high-volume automation

For these situations, a custom-engineered solution delivers better results than adapting standard equipment.

## Our Process

**Discovery** - We start by thoroughly understanding your challenge. Our engineers visit your facility, study your process, and document requirements in detail.

**Concept Development** - We develop multiple concepts and evaluate trade-offs between complexity, cost, and capability. You participate in selecting the direction.

**Detailed Design** - Full mechanical, electrical, and controls engineering with 3D models and simulation where appropriate.

**Build & Test** - Fabrication, assembly, and thorough testing at our facility before shipping.

**Installation** - On-site installation, commissioning, and validation at your facility.

**Training & Support** - Comprehensive training followed by ongoing technical support.

## Engineering Capabilities

Our engineering team brings expertise in:

- Mechanical design and machine building
- Pneumatic and hydraulic systems
- Servo motion control
- PLC programming (Allen-Bradley, Siemens, others)
- HMI development
- Robot integration
- Vision systems
- Safety system design

## Built for Production

We design for production realities: maintenance access, changeover efficiency, and operator ergonomics. Our machines are built to run reliably shift after shift with practical service requirements.
