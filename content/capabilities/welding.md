AMD Automation specializes in custom robotic welding systems that solve the challenges of modern manufacturing: skilled welder shortages, strict quality requirements, and increasing production demands. Our [robotic cells](/capabilities/robotic-cells/) integrate seamlessly into your production environment.

## Robotic Welding Processes

Our team has deep expertise across all major automated welding processes:

### MIG/MAG Welding (GMAW)
Gas metal arc welding for high-speed production of steel and aluminum components. We integrate advanced power sources from Lincoln Electric, Miller, and Fronius with adaptive controls for optimal results. Ideal for [automotive](/industries/automotive/) frames, brackets, and structural assemblies.

### TIG Welding (GTAW)
Gas tungsten arc welding for applications requiring superior weld quality and aesthetics. Perfect for stainless steel, aluminum, and exotic materials in [medical device](/industries/medical/) and [aerospace](/industries/aerospace/) applications.

### Resistance Spot Welding
High-speed spot welding for sheet metal assemblies with precise electrode force and current control. Our systems achieve consistent nugget formation across thousands of welds per shift.

### Laser Welding
High-speed, low-distortion welding for precision applications and thin materials. Fiber laser and CO2 laser systems available for [electronics](/industries/electronics/) enclosures and precision components.

## Welding Power Sources & Wire Feeders

We integrate industry-leading welding equipment:

- **Lincoln Electric** - PowerWave and PulsePower systems
- **Miller Electric** - Auto-Axcess and Continuum platforms
- **Fronius** - TPS/i intelligent welding systems
- **SKS Welding** - Specialized resistance welding equipment
- **IPG Photonics** - Fiber laser welding sources

## Custom Welding Fixturing & Positioning

Successful welding automation requires more than just a robot. We design and build custom fixtures that:

- Locate parts accurately within ±0.5mm tolerance
- Provide optimal torch access for complex weld paths
- Enable quick changeover between part variants
- Include clamping for distortion control

Our servo positioners enable multi-axis manipulation for circumferential welds, tilting, and rotation.

## Weld Quality Monitoring Systems

Our welding systems incorporate real-time monitoring to verify quality:

- **Arc monitoring** - Voltage, current, and wire feed tracking
- **Seam tracking** - Laser and through-arc sensing for joint following
- **Vision inspection** - Post-weld bead inspection and measurement
- **Weld data logging** - Complete traceability for quality records

## Training & Ongoing Support

We provide comprehensive training for your operators and maintenance personnel, including:

- Robot programming and operation
- Welding parameter optimization
- Preventive maintenance procedures
- Troubleshooting common issues

Our support team is available to help optimize your welding processes and provide ongoing technical assistance.
