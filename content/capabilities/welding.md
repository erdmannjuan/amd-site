AMD Automation specializes in custom welding automation systems that solve the challenges of modern manufacturing: labor shortages, quality requirements, and production demands.

## Welding Processes

Our team has deep expertise across all major welding processes:

**MIG/MAG Welding** - Gas metal arc welding for high-speed production of steel and aluminum components. We integrate advanced power sources with adaptive controls for optimal results.

**TIG Welding** - Gas tungsten arc welding for applications requiring superior weld quality and aesthetics, including stainless steel and exotic materials.

**Spot Welding** - Resistance spot welding for sheet metal assemblies with precise electrode force and current control.

**Laser Welding** - High-speed, low-distortion welding for precision applications and thin materials.

## Fixturing & Positioning

Successful welding automation requires more than just a robot. We design and build custom fixtures that locate parts accurately and provide optimal access for the welding torch. Our servo positioners enable multi-axis manipulation for complex weld paths.

## Quality Assurance

Our welding systems incorporate monitoring technology to verify weld quality in real-time. Arc monitoring, vision inspection, and non-destructive testing can be integrated to ensure your quality standards are met.

## Training & Support

We provide comprehensive training for your operators and maintenance personnel. Our support team is available to help optimize your welding parameters and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
