AMD Automation designs and builds automated test systems that protect your quality reputation by verifying every product before it ships.

## Test Types

**Leak Testing** - We implement multiple leak testing technologies including pressure decay, mass flow, and helium tracer gas methods. Our systems detect leaks as small as 0.1 cc/min depending on the method and test parameters.

**Vision Inspection** - Machine vision systems inspect for surface defects, verify dimensions, read codes, and confirm proper assembly. We use industry-leading cameras and lighting to achieve reliable detection.

**Functional Testing** - Custom test stations verify that your product operates as intended. This includes actuating mechanisms, measuring performance parameters, and validating safety features.

**Electrical Testing** - For electrical and electronic assemblies, we integrate continuity testing, insulation resistance measurement, and hipot testing to verify electrical integrity.

## Data Management

Our test systems include comprehensive data collection and reporting capabilities. Every test result is stored with part identification, timestamp, and detailed measurements. This data supports quality documentation, traceability requirements, and continuous improvement initiatives.

## Integration Options

Test systems can be standalone stations or integrated into automated production lines. We design material handling to move parts through testing efficiently and sort passed and failed units automatically.

## Customization

Every test system we build is custom-designed for your specific product and quality requirements. Our engineers work with you to define test parameters, acceptance criteria, and cycle time targets.
