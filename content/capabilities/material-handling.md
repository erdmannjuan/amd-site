AMD Automation designs material handling systems that move your products efficiently through manufacturing, from raw materials to finished goods.

## Conveyor Systems

We design and build conveyor systems tailored to your products and facility:

**Belt Conveyors** - For continuous transport of parts or products of various sizes.

**Roller Conveyors** - Powered or gravity systems for pallets and heavier loads.

**Pallet Transfer Systems** - Precision positioning for assembly and machining operations.

**Flexible Conveyors** - Modular systems that adapt to changing production requirements.

## Pick-and-Place Systems

Automated pick-and-place moves parts between locations with speed and precision. We integrate:

- Cartesian gantry systems for simple motions
- SCARA robots for high-speed picking
- Six-axis robots for complex orientations
- Vision guidance for part location

## Palletizing Solutions

End-of-line palletizing automation handles the heavy lifting of stacking cases and products onto pallets. Our systems include:

- Robotic palletizers for flexibility
- Layer-forming palletizers for speed
- Depalletizing for incoming materials
- Mixed-load palletizing for variety

## Part Orientation & Feeding

Getting parts oriented correctly for downstream operations is often the key to successful automation. Our part feeding solutions include:

- Vibratory feeders with inline tooling
- Vision-guided flex feeders
- Centrifugal feeders for high speeds
- Custom feeding mechanisms

## Integration

Material handling systems must work seamlessly with production equipment. We ensure smooth handoffs with proper sensing, timing, and controls integration. Our systems communicate with your plant network for tracking and control.
