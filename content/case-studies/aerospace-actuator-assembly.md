## Project Overview

Aerospace manufacturing demands the highest levels of quality and traceability. When a leading Tier 1 aerospace supplier needed to scale production of flight-critical hydraulic actuators, they faced stringent requirements that made traditional manual assembly impractical.

Every fastener must be torqued to specification and documented. Every component must be verified as correct. And every step must be traceable for the life of the aircraft.

## AS9100 Compliance by Design

The assembly system was designed from the ground up to meet AS9100D requirements:

### Process Control
- Electronic work instructions guide operators through each step
- Torque tools automatically verify and document every fastener
- Interlocks prevent proceeding until each step is verified complete

### Traceability
- Unique serial numbers scanned at each station
- All process data linked to individual assemblies
- Electronic records retained for product lifetime

### FOD Prevention
- Enclosed work cells with controlled access
- Tool tethering and accountability
- Automated debris collection and verification

## Precision Torque Assembly

The actuator assembly requires 47 fasteners with varying torque specifications. The system uses:

- **DC Electric Tools**: Precise, repeatable torque application
- **Automatic Angle Monitoring**: Verifies proper fastener seating
- **Real-Time Documentation**: Every installation captured and linked to serial number

Any out-of-spec condition immediately stops production and alerts supervision.
