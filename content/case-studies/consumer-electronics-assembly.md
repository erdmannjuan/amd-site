## Project Overview

Consumer electronics markets demand variety. Customers expect multiple colors, configurations, and feature sets—and they expect them fast. For a California-based electronics manufacturer, this meant assembling 12 different SKUs on the same line with frequent model mix changes.

Manual assembly was struggling to keep up. Quality varied between operators, and the high labor costs made domestic manufacturing increasingly difficult to justify.

## Flexibility Through Technology

AMD Machines designed a cell that embraces variety instead of fighting it:

### Vision-Guided Part Handling
The 3D vision system recognizes components regardless of how they're presented. Operators simply refill bins with mixed parts—the robots figure out what's what.

### Automatic Tool Changing
Each robot carries multiple tools optimized for different operations. The system automatically swaps tools based on the current SKU requirements.

### Recipe-Based Programming
When a new product enters the cell, the barcode triggers automatic download of the correct:
- Robot programs
- Vision parameters
- Quality checkpoints
- Assembly sequence

No manual intervention required.

## Collaborative Approach

The FANUC CRX collaborative robots enable a hybrid automation approach:

- **Robots handle**: Repetitive assembly, precision placement, consistent quality
- **Operators handle**: Loading/unloading, quality audits, exception handling

This division of labor optimizes both human skills and robot capabilities.

## New Product Introduction

The flexible architecture dramatically accelerates new product launches:

| Phase | Traditional | With Flexible Cell |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Programming | 2 weeks | 2 days |
| Tooling | 4 weeks | 1 week |
| Validation | 1 week | 2 days |
| **Total** | **7 weeks** | **11 days** |

Three new SKUs have been added since the original 12, with minimal engineering effort.

## Customer Testimonial
