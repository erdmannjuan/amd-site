## Project Overview

A leading Tier-1 automotive supplier approached AMD Automation with a critical capacity challenge. Their suspension control arm production line was bottlenecked at the welding station, where skilled manual welders could only produce 120 parts per shift—far short of the 400+ parts their OEM customers now required.

The stakes were high: failure to meet demand would mean lost business worth over $15M annually.

## Engineering Approach

Our engineering team conducted a thorough analysis of the existing process, identifying several key opportunities:

### Part Analysis
The control arm required 14 individual welds across multiple planes. Manual welders were spending significant time repositioning parts and could only weld one joint at a time.

### Process Optimization
By designing a custom H-frame positioner with dual fixtures, we enabled:
- Loading/unloading on Station A while robots weld on Station B
- Both robots welding simultaneously on opposite sides of the part
- Automatic rotation to present all weld joints without operator intervention

### Quality Integration
Laser seam tracking eliminated the primary source of manual weld defects—inconsistent torch positioning due to stamping variation. Real-time monitoring flags any welds outside specification before the part leaves the cell.

## Implementation

The project was executed in phases to minimize production disruption:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Engineering, robot simulation, and fixture design
**Phase 2 (Months 4-5):** Fabrication and assembly at AMD facility
**Phase 3 (Month 6):** Factory Acceptance Testing with customer parts
**Phase 4 (Months 7-8):** Installation, commissioning, and production ramp

The cell achieved full production rate within 30 days of installation, ahead of the 60-day target.

## Customer Testimonial
