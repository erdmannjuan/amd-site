## Project Overview

Launching a new transmission program is a high-stakes endeavor. When a Tier 1 powertrain supplier won a major OEM contract, they needed an assembly line capable of producing 800+ units per shift with near-zero defects—all within an existing facility with limited floor space.

AMD Machines designed a high-density assembly line that packs 32 robot stations into a compact footprint while maintaining industry-leading uptime and quality.

## Compact Cell Design

Space efficiency was critical. Our engineering team developed innovative cell layouts:

### Dual-Robot Stations
Where traditional designs use one robot per operation, we configured cells with two robots working opposite sides of the pallet simultaneously, doubling productivity per square foot.

### Overhead Services
Utilities, cables, and conveyors routed overhead keep the floor clear for maintenance access while maximizing usable space.

### Integrated Buffers
Strategic buffer stations allow individual cells to cycle for maintenance without stopping the entire line.

## Critical Fastening Operations

Transmission assembly requires precise torque control on dozens of fasteners:

- **48 critical fasteners** per assembly
- **DC electric tools** with ±1% accuracy
- **Angle monitoring** verifies proper seating
- **Automatic documentation** for every fastener

Any out-of-spec torque immediately flags the unit and halts production at that station.

## Launch Success

The line launched on the OEM's aggressive timeline:

- **Week 1-2**: Slow-speed validation
- **Week 3-4**: Ramp to 50% rate
- **Week 5-6**: Full production rate
- **Week 7+**: Sustained 99.5% uptime

The customer has since awarded two additional programs based on this line's success.
