## Project Overview

When a leading medical device manufacturer received FDA clearance for their next-generation minimally invasive surgical instrument, they faced a significant challenge: scaling from prototype production to 50,000 units annually while maintaining the precision and documentation required for Class II medical devices.

Manual assembly was not viable—the instrument contained 23 components requiring sub-millimeter placement accuracy, and FDA regulations demanded 100% traceability of every component and process parameter.

## Regulatory Compliance by Design

From the initial concept, our engineering team designed the system to meet regulatory requirements:

### 21 CFR Part 820 Compliance
- Electronic Device History Records (eDHR) for every unit
- Automatic data collection at each process step
- Secure, tamper-proof audit trail
- User access controls with electronic signatures

### ISO 13485 Requirements
- Documented validation protocols (IQ/OQ/PQ)
- Process capability studies (Cpk > 1.33)
- Preventive maintenance scheduling
- Calibration management integration

### Cleanroom Compatibility
- All robots rated for ISO Class 5 environments
- FDA-compliant lubricants throughout
- Stainless steel and anodized aluminum construction
- Integrated HEPA filtration at critical stations

## Assembly Process

The system performs the complete surgical instrument assembly in a single load:

**Station 1:** Component feeding and orientation verification
**Station 2:** Precision sub-assembly with force monitoring
**Station 3:** Main body assembly with 0.1mm accuracy
**Station 4:** Functional mechanism test
**Station 5:** Final vision inspection and serialization

Each station captures complete process data linked to the unique device identifier (UDI), creating a comprehensive electronic record that travels with the device throughout its lifecycle.

## Validation Success

The validation process proceeded smoothly due to early involvement of the client's quality team:

- **IQ (Installation Qualification):** Verified all equipment installed per specifications
- **OQ (Operational Qualification):** Confirmed system operates within defined parameters
- **PQ (Performance Qualification):** Demonstrated consistent production of conforming product

The FDA inspection following validation resulted in zero Form 483 observations—a testament to the robust design and documentation.

## Customer Testimonial
