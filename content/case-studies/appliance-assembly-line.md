## Project Overview

Product variety is essential for competitiveness in the appliance industry, but it creates manufacturing complexity. A major appliance manufacturer found their dishwasher assembly line—designed years ago for just two variants—struggling to handle eight current models.

Changeovers between variants took 45+ minutes of manual fixture adjustments. Quality suffered as operators rushed through unfamiliar assembly sequences. And chronic labor shortages meant the line often ran short-staffed.

## Flexibility by Design

AMD Automation designed the new line from the ground up for flexibility:

### Automatic Fixture Adjustment
Every fixture uses servo-driven locators that automatically reposition for the incoming variant. When the MES signals a new model, fixtures reconfigure in seconds—not minutes.

### Universal Part Handling
3D vision-guided robots pick components from mixed bins, eliminating the need for model-specific part presentation. The same bin can contain components for all eight variants.

### Recipe-Driven Assembly
Each station stores programs for all variants. When a tub enters the station, the barcode triggers download of the correct sequence, speeds, and parameters.

### Model-Agnostic Testing
Leak test and functional test stations automatically adjust pass/fail criteria based on the specific model being tested.

## Station Breakdown

The 15 robot stations perform complete dishwasher assembly:

**Stations 1-3:** Tub loading and component insertion
**Stations 4-6:** Door assembly and hinge installation
**Stations 7-9:** Spray arm and rack installation
**Stations 10-12:** Pump and motor installation
**Station 13:** Electrical connections and wiring
**Station 14:** Leak testing
**Station 15:** Final inspection and unload

Each station is designed for 55-second cycle time, providing buffer for the 60-second line takt.

## Mixed-Model Production

The line now runs true mixed-model production—different variants can follow each other without any changeover delay. Benefits include:

- **Reduced inventory:** Build to order instead of building batches
- **Faster response:** New orders can enter production immediately
- **Better quality:** Consistent automation versus varied manual processes

## Customer Testimonial

> "We went from dreading variant changeovers to not even thinking about them. The line builds whatever the schedule calls for, in whatever sequence. AMD Automation delivered the flexibility we needed to compete."
