## Project Overview

The electric vehicle revolution is creating unprecedented demand for battery manufacturing capacity. When a leading EV battery manufacturer secured contracts to supply modules for three major automakers, they needed to build production capability from the ground up—and fast.

AMD Machines was selected to design and build a complete battery module assembly line capable of producing 500,000 modules annually, with the flexibility to scale to 750,000 as demand grows.

## Safety-First Design

Battery manufacturing presents unique safety challenges. High-voltage components, flammable electrolytes, and the risk of thermal runaway require careful engineering at every step.

### Electrical Safety
- All robot cells rated for work on energized systems (NFPA 70E compliant)
- Automatic grounding verification before any operation
- Hi-pot testing at multiple stages catches insulation defects
- Emergency disconnect systems throughout the line

### Thermal Monitoring
- Infrared cameras monitor cell temperatures in real-time
- Automatic rejection of any cells showing thermal anomalies
- Fire suppression systems at critical stations
- Thermal runaway containment in testing areas

### Mechanical Safety
- Category 4, Performance Level e safety systems
- Light curtains and area scanners at operator interfaces
- Safe speed monitoring for collaborative operations
- Emergency stop coverage throughout

## Process Flow

The line performs complete module assembly from incoming cells to packaged product:

**Zone 1 - Cell Preparation**
- Incoming cell testing and sorting
- Polarity and voltage verification
- Vision-guided cell stacking

**Zone 2 - Module Assembly**
- Cell-to-busbar laser welding
- Weld quality verification
- Thermal interface material dispensing

**Zone 3 - Electrical Integration**
- BMS installation and connection
- Harness routing and termination
- Insulation resistance testing

**Zone 4 - Final Test & Pack**
- Full electrical characterization
- Capacity and impedance testing
- Labeling and packaging

## Scaling for Growth

The modular design allows capacity expansion without major reconstruction:

- Additional cell preparation stations can be added inline
- Parallel test stations accommodate longer test cycles
- Buffer systems smooth flow between zones
- MES integration enables real-time capacity management

## Customer Testimonial

> "AMD Machines delivered a production line that met our aggressive timeline while exceeding our quality and safety requirements. Their understanding of high-voltage battery manufacturing was evident in every design decision. We're already planning the next line expansion with them."
