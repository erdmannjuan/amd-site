## Project Overview

The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) mandates that pharmaceutical manufacturers serialize products at the unit level and track them through the supply chain. For a mid-sized pharmaceutical company producing over 100 million bottles annually, this requirement meant a complete packaging line upgrade.

The challenge: implement full serialization without sacrificing the 200+ bottles per minute throughput their customers depend on.

## Serialization Architecture

The system implements a complete serialization solution:

### Unit Level
- Unique serial number printed on each bottle label
- 2D DataMatrix barcode for machine readability
- Human-readable serial number for manual verification
- Real-time verification of every printed code

### Case Level
- Serial numbers aggregated as bottles are packed
- Case label with parent serial number and child list
- Verification that all units are present and readable

### Pallet Level
- Cases aggregated during palletizing
- Pallet label with complete hierarchy
- Data transmitted to enterprise serialization repository

## High-Speed Labeling

Achieving 200+ bottles per minute with serialization requires precision engineering:

- **Servo-Driven Labeling**: Precise label placement at high speed
- **Thermal Transfer Printing**: Durable codes that withstand distribution
- **Inline Verification**: Every code read and verified in real-time
- **Automatic Rejection**: Non-conforming units removed without stopping the line

## Validation and Compliance

The complete system was validated per GAMP 5 guidelines:

- **IQ/OQ/PQ Documentation**: Complete qualification protocols
- **21 CFR Part 11 Compliance**: Electronic signatures, audit trails, access controls
- **Data Integrity**: Secure, tamper-evident record keeping
- **Periodic Review**: Ongoing compliance monitoring
