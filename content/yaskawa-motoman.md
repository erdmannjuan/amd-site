## Authorized Yaskawa Motoman Integrator

AMD Machines is a proud authorized Yaskawa Motoman integrator, bringing together over 30 years of automation expertise with Yaskawa's world-class robotics platform. This partnership allows us to deliver fully engineered, turnkey robotic solutions specifically tailored for manufacturing operations in Mexico.

As an authorized integrator, our engineering team is factory-trained and certified to design, program, and commission systems built around Motoman robots. From initial concept through installation and ongoing support, we serve as a single point of responsibility for your automation project.

## Why Yaskawa Motoman

Yaskawa is the world's largest manufacturer of industrial robots, with over 500,000 Motoman robots installed globally. Their product line covers virtually every industrial application:

- **6-axis articulated robots** for welding, assembly, material handling, and machine tending
- **High-speed delta robots** for picking, packing, and sorting
- **Collaborative robots (cobots)** for human-robot work environments
- **Dual-arm robots** for complex assembly tasks requiring dexterity
- **Heavy-payload robots** for palletizing, press tending, and large-part handling

Motoman robots are known for their reliability, speed, and precision — backed by Yaskawa's industry-leading servo and motion control technology. This translates directly into higher uptime and lower total cost of ownership for our customers.

## Custom Automation Solutions for Mexico

AMD Machines brings a unique advantage to manufacturers operating in Mexico. With our engineering base in the United States and deep experience deploying systems across the border, we bridge the gap between advanced automation design and on-the-ground execution in Mexican manufacturing facilities.

**What this means for your operation:**

- **Bilingual engineering support** — our team works seamlessly in both English and Spanish throughout the project lifecycle
- **Cross-border project management** — we handle logistics, customs, and installation coordination between the US and Mexico
- **Local commissioning and training** — our engineers travel to your facility for installation, startup, and operator training
- **Ongoing technical support** — remote diagnostics and on-site service to keep your systems running

Whether you are a US-based manufacturer expanding into Mexico or a Mexican operation looking to modernize, AMD Machines delivers automation solutions that meet international quality standards while addressing the specific needs of manufacturing in Mexico.

## Integration Capabilities

We design and build complete robotic systems around Yaskawa Motoman robots for a wide range of applications:

### Robotic Welding
MIG, TIG, and spot welding cells with offline programming, seam tracking, and automated part handling. Our welding systems deliver consistent quality at production speeds.

### Assembly Automation
Multi-station assembly lines integrating Motoman robots for part placement, fastening, pressing, and verification. We combine robotics with custom fixturing and vision systems for reliable high-volume assembly.

### Material Handling
Pick-and-place, machine tending, and part transfer systems. We integrate robots with conveyors, feeders, and vision-guided picking for flexible material flow.

### Palletizing and Packaging
End-of-line palletizing cells with high-payload Motoman robots. Our systems handle multiple SKUs, pattern changes, and integration with existing packaging lines.

### Machine Vision Integration
2D and 3D vision systems paired with Motoman robots for inspection, guidance, and quality verification. Vision-guided robotics enable flexible automation that adapts to part variation.

## Our Approach

Every AMD Machines project follows a structured process designed to minimize risk and deliver results:

1. **Consultation and assessment** — we evaluate your process, production targets, and facility constraints
2. **Concept design** — our engineers develop a system concept with 3D layouts, cycle time analysis, and ROI projections
3. **Detailed engineering** — mechanical, electrical, and controls design with full documentation
4. **Build and integration** — system assembly, robot programming, and factory acceptance testing at our facility
5. **Installation and commissioning** — on-site installation, startup, and performance validation at your plant in Mexico
6. **Training and support** — operator and maintenance training, plus ongoing technical support
